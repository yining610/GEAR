<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: "Architecture is not about math or zoning -- it's about visceral emotions," says Marc Kushner. In a sweeping — often funny — talk, he zooms through the past thirty years of architecture to show how the public, once disconnected, have become an essential part of the design process. With the help of social media, feedback reaches architects years before a building is even created. The result? Architecture that will do more for us than ever before.</description>

<title>Marc Kushner: Why the buildings of the future will be shaped by ... you</title>

<seg id="1"> Today I'm going to speak to you  about the last 30 years of architectural history.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> That's a lot to pack into 18 minutes.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> It's a complex topic,  so we're just going to dive right in at a complex place:  New Jersey.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Because 30 years ago, I'm from Jersey,  and I was six, and I lived there in my parents' house  in a town called Livingston,  and this was my childhood bedroom.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> Around the corner from my bedroom  was the bathroom that I used to share with my sister.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> And in between my bedroom and the bathroom  was a balcony that overlooked the family room.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> And that's where everyone would hang out and watch TV,  so that every time that I walked from my bedroom to the bathroom,  everyone would see me,  and every time I took a shower and would come back in a towel,  everyone would see me.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And I looked like this.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> I was awkward,  insecure, and I hated it.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> I hated that walk, I hated that balcony,  I hated that room, and I hated that house.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> And that's architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="12">   Done.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> That feeling, those emotions that I felt,  that's the power of architecture,  because architecture is not about math and it's not about zoning,  it's about those visceral, emotional connections  that we feel to the places that we occupy.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> And it's no surprise that we feel that way,  because according to the EPA,  Americans spend 90 percent of their time indoors.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> That's 90 percent of our time surrounded by architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> That's huge.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> That means that architecture is shaping us in ways that we didn't even realize.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> That makes us a little bit gullible and very, very predictable.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> It means that when I show you a building like this,  I know what you think:  You think "power" and "stability" and "democracy."    </seg>
<seg id="20"> And I know you think that because it's based on a building  that was build 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> This is a trick.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is a trigger that architects use  to get you to create an emotional connection  to the forms that we build our buildings out of.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> It's a predictable emotional connection,  and we've been using this trick for a long, long time.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> We used it [200] years ago to build banks.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> And in the 20th century in America,  we used it to build houses.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> And look at these solid, stable little soldiers  facing the ocean and keeping away the elements.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> This is really, really useful,  because building things is terrifying.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> It's expensive, it takes a long time, and it's very complicated.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the people that build things --  developers and governments --  they're naturally afraid of innovation,  and they'd rather just use those forms that they know you'll respond to.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> That's how we end up with buildings like this.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> This is a nice building.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> This is the Livingston Public Library  that was completed in 2004 in my hometown,  and, you know, it's got a dome  and it's got this round thing and columns, red brick,  and you can kind of guess what Livingston is trying to say with this building:  children, property values and history.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> But it doesn't have much to do with what a library actually does today.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country,  another library was completed,  and it looks like this.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> It's in Seattle.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> This library is about how we consume media in a digital age.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> It's about a new kind of public amenity for the city,  a place to gather and read and share.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> So how is it possible  that in the same year, in the same country,  two buildings, both called libraries,  look so completely different?    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And the answer is that architecture works on the principle of a pendulum.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> On the one side is innovation,  and architects are constantly pushing, pushing for new technologies,  new typologies, new solutions for the way that we live today.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> And we push and we push and we push  until we completely alienate all of you.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> We wear all black, we get very depressed,  you think we're adorable,  we're dead inside because we've got no choice.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> We have to go to the other side  and reengage those symbols that we know you love.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> So we do that, and you're happy,  we feel like sellouts,  so we start experimenting again  and we push the pendulum back and back and forth and back and forth  we've gone for the last 300 years,  and certainly for the last 30 years.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> Okay, 30 years ago we were coming out of the '70s.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> Architects had been busy experimenting with something called brutalism.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> It's about concrete.    </seg>
<seg id="49">   You can guess this.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> Small windows, dehumanizing scale.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> This is really tough stuff.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> So as we get closer to the '80s,  we start to reengage those symbols.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> We push the pendulum back into the other direction.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> We take these forms that we know you love  and we update them.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> We add neon  and we add pastels  and we use new materials.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> And you love it.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> And we can't give you enough of it.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> We take Chippendale armoires  and we turned those into skyscrapers,  and skyscrapers can be medieval castles made out of glass.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> Forms got big,  forms got bold and colorful.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> Dwarves became columns.    </seg>
<seg id="61">   Swans grew to the size of buildings.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> It was crazy.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> But it's the '80s, it's cool.    </seg>
<seg id="64">   We're all hanging out in malls  and we're all moving to the suburbs,  and out there, out in the suburbs,  we can create our own architectural fantasies.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> And those fantasies,  they can be Mediterranean  or French  or Italian.    </seg>
<seg id="66">   Possibly with endless breadsticks.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> This is the thing about postmodernism.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> This is the thing about symbols.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> They're easy, they're cheap,  because instead of making places,  we're making memories of places.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> Because I know, and I know all of you know,  this isn't Tuscany.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> This is Ohio.    </seg>
<seg id="72">   So architects get frustrated,  and we start pushing the pendulum back into the other direction.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> In the late '80s and early '90s,  we start experimenting with something called deconstructivism.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> We throw out historical symbols,  we rely on new, computer-aided design techniques,  and we come up with new compositions,  forms crashing into forms.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> This is academic and heady stuff,  it's super unpopular,  we totally alienate you.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> Ordinarily, the pendulum would just swing back into the other direction.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> And then, something amazing happened.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> In 1997, this building opened.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> This is the Guggenheim Bilbao, by Frank Gehry.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> And this building  fundamentally changes the world's relationship to architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> Paul Goldberger said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments  when critics, academics, and the general public  were completely united around a building.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> The New York Times called this building a miracle.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> Tourism in Bilbao increased 2,500 percent after this building was completed.    </seg>
<seg id="84"> So all of a sudden, everybody wants one of these buildings:  L.A.,  Seattle,  Chicago,  New York,  Cleveland,    Everybody wants one, and Gehry is everywhere.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> He is our very first starchitect.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> Now, how is it possible that these forms --  they're wild and radical --  how is it possible that they become so ubiquitous throughout the world?    </seg>
<seg id="87"> And it happened because media so successfully galvanized around them  that they quickly taught us that these forms mean culture and tourism.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> We created an emotional reaction to these forms.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> So did every mayor in the world.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> So every mayor knew that if they had these forms,  they had culture and tourism.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium  happened to a few other starchitects.    </seg>
<seg id="92"> It happened to Zaha  and it happened to Libeskind,  and what happened to these elite few architects  at the turn of the new millennium  could actually start to happen to the entire field of architecture,  as digital media starts to increase the speed  with which we consume information.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> Because think about how you consume architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="94"> A thousand years ago,  you would have had to have walked to the village next door to see a building.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> Transportation speeds up:  You can take a boat, you can take a plane, you can be a tourist.    </seg>
<seg id="96"> Technology speeds up: You can see it in a newspaper, on TV,  until finally, we are all architectural photographers,  and the building has become disembodied from the site.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> Architecture is everywhere now,  and that means that the speed of communication  has finally caught up to the speed of architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="98"> Because architecture actually moves quite quickly.    </seg>
<seg id="99"> It doesn't take long to think about a building.    </seg>
<seg id="100"> It takes a long time to build a building,  three or four years,  and in the interim, an architect will design two or eight  or a hundred other buildings  before they know if that building that they designed four years ago  was a success or not.    </seg>
<seg id="101"> That's because there's never been a good feedback loop in architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="102"> That's how we end up with buildings like this.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> Brutalism wasn't a two-year movement,  it was a 20-year movement.    </seg>
<seg id="104"> For 20 years, we were producing buildings like this  because we had no idea how much you hated it.    </seg>
<seg id="105"> It's never going to happen again,  I think,  because we are living on the verge of the greatest revolution in architecture  since the invention of concrete,  of steel, or of the elevator,  and it's a media revolution.    </seg>
<seg id="106"> So my theory is that when you apply media to this pendulum,  it starts swinging faster and faster,  until it's at both extremes nearly simultaneously,  and that effectively blurs the difference between innovation and symbol,  between us, the architects, and you, the public.    </seg>
<seg id="107"> Now we can make nearly instantaneous, emotionally charged symbols  out of something that's brand new.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> Let me show you how this plays out  in a project that my firm recently completed.    </seg>
<seg id="109"> We were hired to replace this building, which burned down.    </seg>
<seg id="110"> This is the center of a town called the Pines  in Fire Island in New York State.    </seg>
<seg id="111"> It's a vacation community.    </seg>
<seg id="112"> We proposed a building that was audacious,  that was different than any of the forms that the community was used to,  and we were scared and our client was scared  and the community was scared,  so we created a series of photorealistic renderings  that we put onto Facebook  and we put onto Instagram,  and we let people start to do what they do:  share it, comment, like it, hate it.    </seg>
<seg id="113"> But that meant that two years before the building was complete,  it was already a part of the community,  so that when the renderings looked exactly like the finished product,  there were no surprises.    </seg>
<seg id="114"> This building was already a part of this community,  and then that first summer,  when people started arriving and sharing the building on social media,  the building ceased to be just an edifice and it became media,  because these, these are not just pictures of a building,  they're your pictures of a building.    </seg>
<seg id="115"> And as you use them to tell your story,  they become part of your personal narrative,  and what you're doing is you're short-circuiting  all of our collective memory,  and you're making these charged symbols for us to understand.    </seg>
<seg id="116"> That means we don't need the Greeks anymore  to tell us what to think about architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="117"> We can tell each other what we think about architecture,  because digital media hasn't just changed the relationship between all of us,  it's changed the relationship between us and buildings.    </seg>
<seg id="118"> Think for a second about those librarians back in Livingston.    </seg>
<seg id="119"> If that building was going to be built today,  the first thing they would do is go online and search "new libraries."    </seg>
<seg id="120"> They would be bombarded by examples of experimentation, of innovation,  of pushing at the envelope of what a library can be.    </seg>
<seg id="121"> That's ammunition.    </seg>
<seg id="122"> That's ammunition that they can take with them  to the mayor of Livingston, to the people of Livingston,  and say, there's no one answer to what a library is today.    </seg>
<seg id="123"> Let's be a part of this.    </seg>
<seg id="124"> This abundance of experimentation  gives them the freedom to run their own experiment.    </seg>
<seg id="125"> Everything is different now.    </seg>
<seg id="126"> Architects are no longer these mysterious creatures  that use big words and complicated drawings,  and you aren't the hapless public,  the consumer that won't accept anything that they haven't seen anymore.    </seg>
<seg id="127"> Architects can hear you,  and you're not intimidated by architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="128"> That means that that pendulum swinging back and forth  from style to style, from movement to movement,  is irrelevant.    </seg>
<seg id="129"> We can actually move forward  and find relevant solutions to the problems that our society faces.    </seg>
<seg id="130"> This is the end of architectural history,  and it means that the buildings of tomorrow  are going to look a lot different than the buildings of today.    </seg>
<seg id="131"> It means that a public space in the ancient city of Seville  can be unique and tailored to the way that a modern city works.    </seg>
<seg id="132"> It means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be a stadium in Brooklyn,  not some red-brick historical pastiche  of what we think a stadium ought to be.    </seg>
<seg id="133"> It means that robots are going to build our buildings,  because we're finally ready for the forms that they're going to produce.    </seg>
<seg id="134"> And it means that buildings will twist to the whims of nature  instead of the other way around.    </seg>
<seg id="135"> It means that a parking garage in Miami Beach, Florida,  can also be a place for sports  and for yoga  and you can even get married there late at night.    </seg>
<seg id="136">   It means that three architects can dream about swimming  in the East River of New York,  and then raise nearly half a million dollars  from a community that gathered around their cause,  no one client anymore.    </seg>
<seg id="137"> It means that no building is too small for innovation,  like this little reindeer pavilion  that's as muscly and sinewy as the animals it's designed to observe.    </seg>
<seg id="138"> And it means that a building doesn't have to be beautiful  to be lovable,  like this ugly little building in Spain,  where the architects dug a hole,  packed it with hay,  and then poured concrete around it,  and when the concrete dried,  they invited someone to come and clean that hay out  so that all that's left when it's done  is this hideous little room  that's filled with the imprints and scratches of how that place was made,    </seg>
<seg id="139"> and that becomes the most sublime place to watch a Spanish sunset.    </seg>
<seg id="140"> Because it doesn't matter if a cow builds our buildings  or a robot builds our buildings.    </seg>
<seg id="141"> It doesn't matter how we build, it matters what we build.    </seg>
<seg id="142"> Architects already know how to make buildings that are greener  and smarter and friendlier.    </seg>
<seg id="143"> We've just been waiting for all of you to want them.    </seg>
<seg id="144"> And finally, we're not on opposite sides anymore.    </seg>
<seg id="145"> Find an architect, hire an architect,  work with us to design better buildings, better cities, and a better world,  because the stakes are high.    </seg>
<seg id="146"> Buildings don't just reflect our society, they shape our society  down to the smallest spaces:  the local libraries,  the homes where we raise our children,  and the walk that they take from the bedroom to the bathroom.    </seg>
<seg id="147"> Thank you.    </seg>

<title>Meaghan Ramsey: Why thinking you're ugly is bad for you</title>

<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> This is my niece, Stella.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> She's just turned one and started to walk.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> And she's walking in that really cool way that one-year-olds do,  a kind of teetering, my-body's-moving- too-fast-for-my-legs kind of way.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> It is absolutely gorgeous.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> And one of her favorite things to do at the moment  is to stare at herself in the mirror.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> She absolutely loves her reflection.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> She giggles and squeals, and gives herself these big, wet kisses.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is beautiful.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> Apparently, all of her friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do this,  and it got me thinking:  When did I stop doing this?    </seg>
<seg id="10"> When is it suddenly not okay to love the way that we look?    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Because apparently we don't.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> Ten thousand people every month google,  "Am I ugly?"    </seg>
<seg id="13"> This is Faye. Faye is 13 and she lives in Denver.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> And like any teenager, she just wants to be liked and to fit in.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> It's Sunday night.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> She's getting ready for the week ahead at school.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> And she's slightly dreading it, and she's a bit confused because  despite her mom telling her all the time  that she's beautiful,  every day at school, someone tells her that she's ugly.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> Because of the difference between what her mom tells her and what her friends  at school, or her peers at school are telling her,  she doesn't know who to believe.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> So, she takes a video of herself. She posts it to YouTube  and she asks people to please leave a comment:  "Am I pretty or am I ugly?"    </seg>
<seg id="20"> Well, so far, Faye has received over 13,000 comments.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> Some of them are so nasty, they don't bear thinking about.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is an average, healthy-looking teenage girl receiving this feedback  at one of the most emotionally vulnerable times in her life.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> Thousands of people are posting videos like this,  mostly teenage girls, reaching out in this way.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> But what's leading them to do this?    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Well, today's teenagers are rarely alone.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> They're under pressure to be online and available at all times,  talking, messaging, liking, commenting, sharing, posting —  it never ends.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> Never before have we been so connected,  so continuously, so instantaneously, so young.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> And as one mom told me, it's like there's a party in their bedroom every night.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> There's simply no privacy.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> And the social pressures that go along with that are relentless.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> This always-on environment is training our kids to value themselves  based on the number of likes they get  and the types of comments that they receive.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> There's no separation between online and offline life.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> What's real or what isn't is really hard to tell the difference between.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> And it's also really hard to tell the difference between what's authentic  and what's digitally manipulated.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> What's a highlight in someone's life versus what's normal in the context of everyday.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> And where are they looking to for inspiration?    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Well, you can see the kinds of images that are covering the newsfeeds  of girls today.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Size zero models still dominate our catwalks.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> Airbrushing is now routine.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> And trends like #thinspiration, #thighgap,  #bikinibridge and #proana.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> For those who don't know, #proana means pro-anorexia.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> These trends are teamed with the stereotyping and flagrant objectification  of women in today's popular culture.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> It is not hard to see what girls are benchmarking themselves against.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> But boys are not immune to this either.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> Aspiring to the chiseled jaw lines and ripped six packs of superhero-like sports stars  and playboy music artists.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> But, what's the problem with all of this?    </seg>
<seg id="47"> Well, surely we want our kids to grow up as healthy, well balanced individuals.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> But in an image-obsessed culture, we are training our kids  to spend more time and mental effort on their appearance  at the expense of all of the other aspects of their identities.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> So, things like their relationships, the development of their physical abilities,  and their studies and so on begin to suffer.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> Six out of 10 girls are now choosing not to do something because they don't  think they look good enough.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> These are not trivial activities.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> These are fundamental activities to their development as humans and as contributors to society and to the workforce.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Thirty-one percent, nearly one in three teenagers, are withdrawing  from classroom debate. They're failing  to engage in classroom debate because  they don't want to draw attention to the way that they look.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> One in five are not showing up to class at all  on days when they don't feel good about it.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> And when it comes to exams,  if you don't think you look good enough,  specifically if you don't think you are thin enough,  you will score a lower grade point average  than your peers who are not concerned with this.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> And this is consistent across Finland, the U.S.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> and China, and is true regardless of how much you actually weigh.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> So to be super clear, we're talking about the  way you think you look, not how you actually look.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> Low body confidence is undermining academic achievement.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> But it's also damaging health.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> Teenagers with low body confidence do less physical activity,  eat less fruits and vegetables,  partake in more unhealthy weight control practices  that can lead to eating disorders.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> They have lower self-esteem.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> They're more easily influenced by people around them  and they're at greater risk of depression.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> And we think it's for all of these reasons that they take more risks  with things like alcohol and drug use;  crash dieting; cosmetic surgery; unprotected, earlier sex;  and self-harm.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> The pursuit of the perfect body is putting pressure on our healthcare systems  and costing our governments billions of dollars every year.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> And we don't grow out of it.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> Women who think they're overweight — again,  regardless of whether they are or are not —  have higher rates of absenteeism.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> Seventeen percent of women would  not show up to a job interview on  a day when they weren't feeling confident about the way that they look.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> Have a think about what this is doing  to our economy.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> If we could overcome this, what that  opportunity looks like.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> Unlocking this potential is in the interest  of every single one of us.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> But how do we do that?    </seg>
<seg id="73"> Well, talking, on its own, only gets you so far.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> It's not enough by itself.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> If you actually want to make a difference,  you have to do something.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> And we've learned there are three key ways:  The first is we have to educate for body confidence.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> We have to help our teenagers develop  strategies to overcome image-related pressures  and build their self-esteem.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> Now, the good news is that there are  many programs out there available to do this.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> The bad news is that most of them don't work.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> I was shocked to learn that many well-meaning  programs are inadvertently actually  making the situation worse.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> So we need to make damn sure that  the programs that our kids are receiving  are not only having a positive impact,  but having a lasting impact as well.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> And the research shows that the best programs  address six key areas:  The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> The second is media and celebrity culture,  then how to handle teasing and bullying,  the way we compete and compare with one another  talking about appearance — some people  call this "body talk" or "fat talk" —  and finally, the foundations of respecting  and looking after yourself.    </seg>
<seg id="84"> These six things are crucial starting points  for anyone serious about delivering  body-confidence education that works.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> An education is critical,  but tackling this problem is going  to require each and everyone of us  to step up and be better role models  for the women and girls in our own lives.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> Challenging the status quo of how  women are seen and talked about in our own circles.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> It is not okay that we judge the contribution  of our politicians by their haircuts  or the size of their breasts,  or to infer that the determination or the success of an Olympian is down to her not being a looker.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> We need to start judging people by what they do,  not what they look like.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> We can all start by taking responsibility for the types of pictures  and comments that we post  on our own social networks.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> We can compliment people based on their effort  and their actions  and not on their appearance.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> And let me ask you,  when was the last time that you  kissed a mirror?    </seg>
<seg id="92"> Ultimately, we need to work together  as communities, as governments  and as businesses to really change this culture of ours  so that our kids grow up valuing their whole selves,  valuing individuality, diversity, inclusion.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> We need to put the people that are making a real difference  on our pedestals, making a difference  in the real world.    </seg>
<seg id="94"> Giving them the airtime, because only then  will we create a different world.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> A world where our kids are free to become  the best versions of themselves,  where the way they think they look  never holds them back from being who they are  or achieving what they want in life.    </seg>
<seg id="96"> Think about what this might mean for someone in your life.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> Who have you got in mind?    </seg>
<seg id="98"> Is it your wife?    </seg>
<seg id="99"> Your sister?    </seg>
<seg id="100"> Your daughter?    </seg>
<seg id="101"> Your niece?    </seg>
<seg id="102"> Your friend? It could just be the woman a couple of seats away  from you today.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> What would it mean for her  if she were freed from that voice  of her inner critic, nagging her to have  longer legs, thinner thighs, smaller stomach,  shorter feet?    </seg>
<seg id="104"> What could it mean for her if we overcame this  and unlocked her potential in that way?    </seg>
<seg id="105"> Right now, our culture's obsession  with image is holding us all back.    </seg>
<seg id="106"> But let's show our kids the truth.    </seg>
<seg id="107"> Let's show them that the way you look  is just one part of your identity  and that the truth is we love them  for who they are  and what they do  and how they make us feel.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> Let's build self-esteem into our school curriculums.    </seg>
<seg id="109"> Let's each and every one of us change the way  we talk and compare ourselves to other people.    </seg>
<seg id="110"> And let's work together as communities,  from grassroots to governments,  so that the happy little one-year-olds  of today become the confident  changemakers of tomorrow.    </seg>
<seg id="111"> Let's do this.    </seg>

<title>Zak Ebrahim: I am the son of a terrorist. Here's how I chose peace.</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> On November 5th, 1990,  a man named El-Sayyid Nosair walked  into a hotel in Manhattan  and assassinated Rabbi Meir Kahane,  the leader of the Jewish Defense League.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> Nosair was initially found not guilty of the murder,  but while serving time on lesser charges,  he and other men began planning attacks  on a dozen New York City landmarks,  including tunnels, synagogues  and the United Nations headquarters.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Thankfully, those plans were foiled  by an FBI informant.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Sadly, the 1993 bombing  of the World Trade Center was not.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> Nosair would eventually be convicted  for his involvement in the plot.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> El-Sayyid Nosair is my father.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania  in 1983 to him, an Egyptian engineer,  and a loving American mother and grade school teacher,  who together tried their best  to create a happy childhood for me.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> It wasn't until I was seven years old  that our family dynamic started to change.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> My father exposed me to a side of Islam  that few people, including the majority of Muslims,  get to see.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> It's been my experience that when people  take the time to interact with one another,  it doesn't take long to realize that for the most part,  we all want the same things out of life.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> However, in every religion, in every population,  you'll find a small percentage of people  who hold so fervently to their beliefs  that they feel they must use any means necessary  to make others live as they do.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> A few months prior to his arrest,  he sat me down and explained that  for the past few weekends, he and some friends  had been going to a shooting range on Long Island  for target practice.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> He told me I'd be going with him the next morning.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> We arrived at Calverton Shooting Range,  which unbeknownst to our group was being watched  by the FBI.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> When it was my turn to shoot,  my father helped me hold the rifle to my shoulder  and explained how to aim at the target  about 30 yards off.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> That day, the last bullet I shot  hit the small orange light that sat on top of the target  and to everyone's surprise, especially mine,  the entire target burst into flames.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> My uncle turned to the other men,  and in Arabic said, "Ibn abuh."    </seg>
<seg id="18"> Like father, like son.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> They all seemed to get a really big laugh out of that comment,  but it wasn't until a few years later  that I fully understood what they thought was so funny.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> They thought they saw in me the same destruction  my father was capable of.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> Those men would eventually be convicted  of placing a van filled with 1,500 pounds of explosives  into the sub-level parking lot of the World Trade Center's North Tower,  causing an explosion that killed six people  and injured over 1,000 others.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> These were the men I looked up to.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> These were the men I called ammu, which means uncle.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> By the time I turned 19,  I had already moved 20 times in my life,  and that instability during my childhood  didn't really provide an opportunity  to make many friends.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Each time I would begin to feel comfortable around someone,  it was time to pack up and move to the next town.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Being the perpetual new face in class,  I was frequently the target of bullies.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> I kept my identity a secret from my classmates  to avoid being targeted,  but as it turns out, being the quiet, chubby new kid in class  was more than enough ammunition.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> So for the most part, I spent my time at home  reading books and watching TV  or playing video games.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> For those reasons, my social skills were lacking,  to say the least,  and growing up in a bigoted household,  I wasn't prepared for the real world.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> I'd been raised to judge people  based on arbitrary measurements,  like a person's race or religion.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> So what opened my eyes?    </seg>
<seg id="32"> One of my first experiences  that challenged this way of thinking  was during the 2000 presidential elections.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Through a college prep program,  I was able to take part  in the National Youth Convention in Philadelphia.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> My particular group's focus was on youth violence,  and having been the victim of bullying for most of my life,  this was a subject in which I felt particularly passionate.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> The members of our group came from many different walks of life.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> One day toward the end of the convention,  I found out that one of the kids I had befriended  was Jewish.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Now, it had taken several days  for this detail to come to light,  and I realized that there was no natural animosity  between the two of us.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> I had never had a Jewish friend before,  and frankly I felt a sense of pride  in having been able to overcome a barrier  that for most of my life I had been led to believe  was insurmountable.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> Another major turning point came when  I found a summer job at Busch Gardens,  an amusement park.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> There, I was exposed to people from all sorts of faiths and cultures,  and that experience proved to be fundamental  to the development of my character.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> Most of my life, I'd been taught  that homosexuality was a sin, and by extension,  that all gay people were a negative influence.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> As chance would have it, I had the opportunity  to work with some of the gay performers  at a show there,  and soon found that many were the kindest,  least judgmental people I had ever met.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Being bullied as a kid  created a sense of empathy in me  toward the suffering of others,  and it comes very unnaturally to me  to treat people who are kind  in any other way than how I would want to be treated.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> Because of that feeling, I was able  with real life experience and interaction.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> I don't know what it's like to be gay,  but I'm well acquainted with being judged  for something that's beyond my control.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> Then there was "The Daily Show."    </seg>
<seg id="47"> On a nightly basis, Jon Stewart forced me  to be intellectually honest with myself about my own bigotry  and helped me to realize that a person's race,  religion or sexual orientation  had nothing to do with the quality of one's character.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> He was in many ways a father figure to me  when I was in desperate need of one.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> Inspiration can often come from an unexpected place,  and the fact that a Jewish comedian had done more  to positively influence my worldview  than my own extremist father  is not lost on me.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> One day, I had a conversation with my mother  about how my worldview was starting to change,  and she said something to me  that I will hold dear to my heart  for as long as I live.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> She looked at me with the weary eyes  of someone who had experienced  enough dogmatism to last a lifetime, and said,  "I'm tired of hating people."    </seg>
<seg id="52"> In that instant, I realized how much negative energy  it takes to hold that hatred inside of you.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Zak Ebrahim is not my real name.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> I changed it when my family decided  to end our connection with my father  and start a new life.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> So why would I out myself  and potentially put myself in danger?    </seg>
<seg id="56"> Well, that's simple.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> I do it in the hopes that perhaps someone someday  who is compelled to use violence  may hear my story and realize  that there is a better way,  that although I had been subjected  to this violent, intolerant ideology,  that I did not become fanaticized.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> Instead, I choose to use my experience  to fight back against terrorism,  against the bigotry.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> I do it for the victims of terrorism  and their loved ones,  for the terrible pain and loss  that terrorism has forced upon their lives.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> For the victims of terrorism, I will speak out  against these senseless acts  and condemn my father's actions.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> And with that simple fact, I stand here as proof  that violence isn't inherent in one's religion or race,  and the son does not have to follow  the ways of his father.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> I am not my father.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> Thank you.   Thank you, everybody.   Thank you all.   Thanks a lot.     </seg>

<title>David Chalmers: How do you explain consciousness?</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> Right now  you have a movie playing inside your head.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> It's an amazing multi-track movie.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> It has 3D vision and surround sound  for what you're seeing and hearing right now,  but that's just the start of it.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Your movie has smell and taste and touch.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> It has a sense of your body,  pain, hunger, orgasms.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> It has emotions,  anger and happiness.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> It has memories, like scenes from your childhood  playing before you.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it has this constant voiceover narrative  in your stream of conscious thinking.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> At the heart of this movie is you  experiencing all this directly.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> This movie is your stream of consciousness,  the subject of experience  of the mind and the world.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Consciousness is one of the fundamental facts  of human existence.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> Each of us is conscious.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> We all have our own inner movie,  you and you and you.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> There's nothing we know about more directly.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> At least, I know about my consciousness directly.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> I can't be certain that you guys are conscious.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> Consciousness also is what makes life worth living.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives  would have meaning or value.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> But at the same time, it's the most  mysterious phenomenon in the universe.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> Why are we conscious?    </seg>
<seg id="21"> Why do we have these inner movies?    </seg>
<seg id="22"> Why aren't we just robots  who process all this input,  produce all that output,  without experiencing the inner movie at all?    </seg>
<seg id="23"> Right now, nobody knows the answers  to those questions.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> I'm going to suggest that to integrate consciousness  into science, some radical ideas may be needed.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Some people say a science of consciousness  is impossible.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Science, by its nature, is objective.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> Consciousness, by its nature, is subjective.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> So there can never be a science of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> For much of the 20th century, that view held sway.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Psychologists studied behavior objectively,  neuroscientists studied the brain objectively,  and nobody even mentioned consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> Even 30 years ago, when TED got started,  there was very little scientific work  on consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> Now, about 20 years ago,  all that began to change.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Neuroscientists like Francis Crick  and physicists like Roger Penrose  said now is the time for science  to attack consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> And since then, there's been a real explosion,  a flowering of scientific work  on consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> And this work has been wonderful. It's been great.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> But it also has some fundamental  limitations so far.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> The centerpiece  of the science of consciousness in recent years  has been the search for correlations,  correlations between certain areas of the brain  and certain states of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> We saw some of this kind of work  from Nancy Kanwisher and the wonderful work  she presented just a few minutes ago.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> Now we understand much better, for example,  the kinds of brain areas that go along with  the conscious experience of seeing faces  or of feeling pain  or of feeling happy.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> But this is still a science of correlations.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> It's not a science of explanations.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> We know that these brain areas  go along with certain kinds of conscious experience,  but we don't know why they do.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> I like to put this by saying  that this kind of work from neuroscience  is answering some of the questions  we want answered about consciousness,  the questions about what certain brain areas do  and what they correlate with.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> But in a certain sense, those are the easy problems.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> No knock on the neuroscientists.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> There are no truly easy problems with consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> But it doesn't address the real mystery  at the core of this subject:  why is it that all that physical processing in a brain  should be accompanied by consciousness at all?    </seg>
<seg id="48"> Why is there this inner subjective movie?    </seg>
<seg id="49"> Right now, we don't really have a bead on that.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> And you might say,  let's just give neuroscience a few years.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> It'll turn out to be another emergent phenomenon  like traffic jams, like hurricanes,  like life, and we'll figure it out.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> The classical cases of emergence  are all cases of emergent behavior,  how a traffic jam behaves,  how a hurricane functions,  how a living organism reproduces  and adapts and metabolizes,  all questions about objective functioning.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> You could apply that to the human brain  in explaining some of the behaviors  and the functions of the human brain  as emergent phenomena:  how we walk, how we talk, how we play chess,  all these questions about behavior.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> But when it comes to consciousness,  questions about behavior  are among the easy problems.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> When it comes to the hard problem,  that's the question of why is it  that all this behavior  is accompanied by subjective experience?    </seg>
<seg id="56"> And here, the standard paradigm  of emergence,  even the standard paradigms of neuroscience,  don't really, so far, have that much to say.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> Now, I'm a scientific materialist at heart.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> I want a scientific theory of consciousness  that works,  and for a long time, I banged my head  against the wall  looking for a theory of consciousness  in purely physical terms  that would work.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> But I eventually came to the conclusion  that that just didn't work for systematic reasons.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> It's a long story,  but the core idea is just that what you get  from purely reductionist explanations in physical terms, in brain-based terms,  is stories about the functioning of a system,  its structure, its dynamics,  the behavior it produces,  great for solving the easy problems —  how we behave, how we function —  but when it comes to subjective experience —  why does all this feel like something from the inside? —    </seg>
<seg id="61"> that's something fundamentally new,  and it's always a further question.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> So I think we're at a kind of impasse here.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> We've got this wonderful, great chain of explanation,  we're used to it, where physics explains chemistry,  chemistry explains biology,  biology explains parts of psychology.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> But consciousness  doesn't seem to fit into this picture.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> On the one hand, it's a datum  that we're conscious.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> On the other hand, we don't know how  to accommodate it into our scientific view of the world.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> So I think consciousness right now  is a kind of anomaly,  one that we need to integrate  into our view of the world, but we don't yet see how.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> Faced with an anomaly like this,  radical ideas may be needed,  and I think that we may need one or two ideas  that initially seem crazy  before we can come to grips with consciousness  scientifically. Now, there are a few candidates  for what those crazy ideas might be.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> His crazy idea is that there is no hard problem  of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> The whole idea of the inner subjective movie  involves a kind of illusion or confusion.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> Actually, all we've got to do is explain  the objective functions, the behaviors of the brain,  and then we've explained everything  that needs to be explained.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> Well I say, more power to him.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore  if you want to have a purely reductionist  brain-based theory of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> At the same time, for me and for many other people,  that view is a bit too close to simply  denying the datum of consciousness  to be satisfactory.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> So I go in a different direction.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> In the time remaining,  I want to explore two crazy ideas  that I think may have some promise.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> The first crazy idea  is that consciousness is fundamental.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> Physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe  as fundamental building blocks:  space and time and mass.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> They postulate fundamental laws governing them,  like the laws of gravity or of quantum mechanics.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> These fundamental properties and laws  aren't explained in terms of anything more basic.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> Rather, they're taken as primitive,  and you build up the world from there.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> Now sometimes, the list of fundamentals expands.    </seg>
<seg id="84"> In the 19th century, Maxwell figured out  that you can't explain electromagnetic phenomena in terms of the existing fundamentals —  space, time, mass, Newton's laws —  so he postulated fundamental laws  of electromagnetism  and postulated electric charge  as a fundamental element  that those laws govern.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> I think that's the situation we're in  with consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> If you can't explain consciousness in terms of the existing fundamentals —  space, time, mass, charge —  then as a matter of logic, you need to expand the list.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> The natural thing to do is to postulate  consciousness itself as something fundamental,  a fundamental building block of nature.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> This doesn't mean you suddenly can't do science with it.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> This opens up the way for you to do science with it.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> What we then need is to study  the fundamental laws governing consciousness,  the laws that connect consciousness  to other fundamentals: space, time, mass,  physical processes.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> Physicists sometimes say  that we want fundamental laws so simple  that we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.    </seg>
<seg id="92"> Well I think something like that is the situation  we're in with consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> We want to find fundamental laws so simple  we could write them on the front of a t-shirt.    </seg>
<seg id="94"> We don't know what those laws are yet,  but that's what we're after.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> The second crazy idea  is that consciousness might be universal.    </seg>
<seg id="96"> Every system might have some degree  of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> This view is sometimes called panpsychism:  pan for all, psych for mind,  every system is conscious,  not just humans, dogs, mice, flies,  but even Rob Knight's microbes,  elementary particles.    </seg>
<seg id="98"> Even a photon has some degree of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="99"> The idea is not that photons are intelligent  or thinking.    </seg>
<seg id="100"> It's not that a photon  is wracked with angst  because it's thinking, "Aww, I'm always buzzing around near the speed of light.    </seg>
<seg id="101"> I never get to slow down and smell the roses."    </seg>
<seg id="102"> No, not like that.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> But the thought is maybe photons might have  some element of raw, subjective feeling,  some primitive precursor to consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="104"> This may sound a bit kooky to you.    </seg>
<seg id="105"> I mean, why would anyone think such a crazy thing?    </seg>
<seg id="106"> Some motivation comes from the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental.    </seg>
<seg id="107"> If it's fundamental, like space and time and mass,  it's natural to suppose that it might be universal too,  the way they are.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> It's also worth noting that although the idea  seems counterintuitive to us,  it's much less counterintuitive to people  from different cultures,  where the human mind is seen as much more  continuous with nature.    </seg>
<seg id="109"> A deeper motivation comes from the idea that  perhaps the most simple and powerful way  to find fundamental laws connecting consciousness  to physical processing  is to link consciousness to information.    </seg>
<seg id="110"> Wherever there's information processing,  there's consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="111"> Complex information processing, like in a human,  complex consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="112"> Simple information processing,  simple consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="113"> A really exciting thing is in recent years  a neuroscientist, Giulio Tononi,  has taken this kind of theory  and developed it rigorously  with a mathematical theory.    </seg>
<seg id="114"> He has a mathematical measure  of information integration  which he calls phi,  measuring the amount of information  integrated in a system.    </seg>
<seg id="115"> And he supposes that phi goes along  with consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="116"> So in a human brain,  incredibly large amount of information integration,  high degree of phi,  a whole lot of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="117"> In a mouse, medium degree of information integration,  still pretty significant,  pretty serious amount of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="118"> But as you go down to worms,  microbes, particles,  the amount of phi falls off.    </seg>
<seg id="119"> The amount of information integration falls off,  but it's still non-zero.    </seg>
<seg id="120"> On Tononi's theory,  there's still going to be a non-zero degree  of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="121"> In effect, he's proposing a fundamental law  of consciousness: high phi, high consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="122"> Now, I don't know if this theory is right,  but it's actually perhaps the leading theory right now  in the science of consciousness,  and it's been used to integrate a whole range  of scientific data,  and it does have a nice property that it is in fact simple enough  you can write it on the front of a t-shirt.    </seg>
<seg id="123"> Another final motivation is that  panpsychism might help us to integrate  consciousness into the physical world.    </seg>
<seg id="124"> Physicists and philosophers have often observed  that physics is curiously abstract.    </seg>
<seg id="125"> It describes the structure of reality  using a bunch of equations,  but it doesn't tell us about the reality  that underlies it.    </seg>
<seg id="126"> As Stephen Hawking puts it,  what puts the fire into the equations?    </seg>
<seg id="127"> Well, on the panpsychist view,  you can leave the equations of physics as they are,  but you can take them to be describing  the flux of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="128"> That's what physics really is ultimately doing,  describing the flux of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="129"> On this view, it's consciousness  that puts the fire into the equations.    </seg>
<seg id="130"> On that view, consciousness doesn't dangle  outside the physical world  as some kind of extra.    </seg>
<seg id="131"> It's there right at its heart.    </seg>
<seg id="132"> This view, I think, the panpsychist view,  has the potential to transfigure our relationship  to nature,  and it may have some pretty serious social  and ethical consequences.    </seg>
<seg id="133"> Some of these may be counterintuitive.    </seg>
<seg id="134"> I used to think I shouldn't eat anything  which is conscious,  so therefore I should be vegetarian.    </seg>
<seg id="135"> Now, if you're a panpsychist and you take that view,  you're going to go very hungry.    </seg>
<seg id="136"> So I think when you think about it,  this tends to transfigure your views,  whereas what matters for ethical purposes  and moral considerations,  not so much the fact of consciousness,  but the degree and the complexity of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="137"> It's also natural to ask about consciousness in other systems, like computers.    </seg>
<seg id="138"> What about the artificially intelligent system  in the movie "Her," Samantha?    </seg>
<seg id="139"> Is she conscious?    </seg>
<seg id="140"> Well, if you take the informational,  panpsychist view,  she certainly has complicated information processing  and integration,  so the answer is very likely yes, she is conscious.    </seg>
<seg id="141"> If that's right, it raises pretty serious  ethical issues about both the ethics of developing intelligent computer systems  and the ethics of turning them off.    </seg>
<seg id="142"> Finally, you might ask about the consciousness  of whole groups,  the planet.    </seg>
<seg id="143"> Does Canada have its own consciousness?    </seg>
<seg id="144"> Or at a more local level,  like the audience at a TED conference,  are we right now having a collective TED consciousness,  for this collective TED group  which is distinct from the inner movies  of each of our parts?    </seg>
<seg id="145"> I don't know the answer to that question,  but I think it's at least one  worth taking seriously.    </seg>
<seg id="146"> Okay, so this panpsychist vision,  it is a radical one,  and I don't know that it's correct.    </seg>
<seg id="147"> I'm actually more confident about the first crazy idea,  that consciousness is fundamental,  than about the second one,  that it's universal.    </seg>
<seg id="148"> I mean, the view raises any number of questions,  has any number of challenges,  like how do those little bits  of consciousness add up  to the kind of complex consciousness  If we can answer those questions,  then I think we're going to be well on our way  to a serious theory of consciousness.    </seg>
<seg id="149"> If not, well, this is the hardest problem perhaps  in science and philosophy.    </seg>
<seg id="150"> We can't expect to solve it overnight.    </seg>
<seg id="151"> But I do think we're going to figure it out eventually.    </seg>
<seg id="152"> Understanding consciousness is a real key, I think,  both to understanding the universe  and to understanding ourselves.    </seg>
<seg id="153"> It may just take the right crazy idea.    </seg>
<seg id="154"> Thank you.    </seg>

<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> I grew up in a very small country town  I had a very normal, low-key kind of upbringing.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> I went to school, I hung out with my friends,  I fought with my younger sisters.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> It was all very normal.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> And when I was 15, a member of my local community  approached my parents  and wanted to nominate me  for a community achievement award.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> And my parents said, "Hm, that's really nice,  but there's kind of one glaring problem with that.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> She hasn't actually achieved anything."   And they were right, you know.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> I went to school, I got good marks,  I had a very low-key after school job  in my mum's hairdressing salon,  and I spent a lot of time watching  "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and "Dawson's Creek."    </seg>
<seg id="8"> Yeah, I know. What a contradiction.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> But they were right, you know.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> I wasn't doing anything that was out of the ordinary  at all.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> I wasn't doing anything that could be considered an achievement  if you took disability out of the equation.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> Years later, I was on my second teaching round  in a Melbourne high school,  and I was about 20 minutes into a year 11 legal studies class  when this boy put up his hand and said,  "Hey miss, when are you going to start doing your speech?"    </seg>
<seg id="13"> And I said, "What speech?"    </seg>
<seg id="14"> You know, I'd been talking them  about defamation law for a good 20 minutes.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> And he said, "You know, like,  your motivational speaking.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> You know, when people in wheelchairs come to school,  they usually say, like, inspirational stuff?"    </seg>
<seg id="17">   "It's usually in the big hall."    </seg>
<seg id="18"> And that's when it dawned on me:  This kid had only ever experienced disabled people  as objects of inspiration.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> We are not, to this kid --  and it's not his fault, I mean,  that's true for many of us.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> For lots of us, disabled people are not our teachers  or our doctors or our manicurists.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> We're not real people. We are there to inspire.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> And in fact, I am sitting on this stage  looking like I do in this wheelchair,  and you are probably kind of expecting me  to inspire you. Right?   Yeah.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid  I'm going to disappoint you dramatically.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> I am not here to inspire you.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> I am here to tell you that we have been lied to  about disability.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Yeah, we've been sold the lie  that disability is a Bad Thing, capital B, capital T.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> It's a bad thing, and to live with a disability  makes you exceptional.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> It's not a bad thing, and it doesn't  make you exceptional.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> And in the past few years, we've been able  to propagate this lie even further  via social media.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> You may have seen images like this one:  "The only disability in life is a bad attitude."    </seg>
<seg id="31"> Or this one: "Your excuse is invalid." Indeed.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> Or this one: "Before you quit, try!"    </seg>
<seg id="33"> These are just a couple of examples,  but there are a lot of these images out there.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> You know, you might have seen the one,  the little girl with no hands  drawing a picture with a pencil held in her mouth.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> You might have seen a child running  on carbon fiber prosthetic legs.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> And these images,  there are lots of them out there,  they are what we call inspiration porn.    </seg>
<seg id="37">   And I use the term porn deliberately,  because they objectify one group of people  for the benefit of another group of people.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> So in this case, we're objectifying disabled people  for the benefit of nondisabled people.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> The purpose of these images  is to inspire you, to motivate you,  so that we can look at them  and think, "Well, however bad my life is,  it could be worse.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> I could be that person."    </seg>
<seg id="41"> But what if you are that person?    </seg>
<seg id="42"> I've lost count of the number of times that I've  been approached by strangers  wanting to tell me that they think I'm brave  or inspirational,  and this was long before my work  had any kind of public profile.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> They were just kind of congratulating me  for managing to get up in the morning  and remember my own name.   And it is objectifying.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> These images, those images  objectify disabled people  for the benefit of nondisabled people.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> They are there so that you can look at them  and think that things aren't so bad for you,  to put your worries into perspective.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> And life as a disabled person  is actually somewhat difficult.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> We do overcome some things.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> But the things that we're overcoming  are not the things that you think they are.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> They are not things to do with our bodies.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> I use the term "disabled people" quite deliberately,  because I subscribe to what's called the social model of disability,  which tells us that we are more disabled  by the society that we live in  than by our bodies and our diagnoses.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> So I have lived in this body a long time.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> I'm quite fond of it.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> It does the things that I need it to do,  and I've learned to use it to the best of its capacity  just as you have,  and that's the thing about those kids in those pictures as well.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> They're not doing anything out of the ordinary.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> They are just using their bodies  to the best of their capacity.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> So is it really fair to objectify them  in the way that we do,  to share those images?    </seg>
<seg id="57"> People, when they say, "You're an inspiration,"  they mean it as a compliment.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> And I know why it happens.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> It's because of the lie, it's because we've been sold  this lie that disability makes you exceptional.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> And it honestly doesn't.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> And I know what you're thinking.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> You know, I'm up here bagging out inspiration,  and you're thinking, "Jeez, Stella,  aren't you inspired sometimes by some things?"    </seg>
<seg id="63"> And the thing is, I am.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> I learn from other disabled people all the time.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> I'm learning not that I am luckier than them, though.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> I am learning that it's a genius idea  to use a pair of barbecue tongs  to pick up things that you dropped.   I'm learning that nifty trick where you can charge  your mobile phone battery from your chair battery.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> Genius.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> We are learning from each others' strength and endurance,  not against our bodies and our diagnoses,  but against a world that exceptionalizes  and objectifies us.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> I really think that this lie that we've been sold  about disability is the greatest injustice.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> It makes life hard for us.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> And that quote, "The only disability in life  is a bad attitude,"  the reason that that's bullshit  is because it's just not true,  because of the social model of disability.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> No amount of smiling at a flight of stairs  has ever made it turn into a ramp.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> Never.    Smiling at a television screen  isn't going to make closed captions appear  for people who are deaf.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> No amount of standing in the middle of a bookshop  and radiating a positive attitude  is going to turn all those books into braille.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> It's just not going to happen.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> I really want to live in a world  where disability is not the exception, but the norm.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> sitting in her bedroom  watching "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"  isn't referred to as achieving anything  because she's doing it sitting down.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> I want to live in a world  where we don't have such low expectations  of disabled people  that we are congratulated for getting out of bed and remembering our own names in the morning.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement  for disabled people,  and I want to live in a world  where a kid in year 11 in a Melbourne high school  is not one bit surprised that his new teacher is a wheelchair user.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> Disability doesn't make you exceptional,  but questioning what you think you know about it does.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> Thank you.    </seg>

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Chris Kluwe wants to look into the future of sports and think about how technology will help not just players and coaches, but fans. Here the former NFL punter envisions a future in which augmented reality will help people experience sports as if they are directly on the field -- and maybe even help them see others in a new light, too.</description>

<title>Chris Kluwe: How augmented reality will change sports ... and build empathy</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> What do augmented reality  and professional football  have to do with empathy?    </seg>
<seg id="2"> And what is the air speed velocity  of an unladen swallow?    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now unfortunately, I'm only going to answer  one of those questions today,  so please, try and contain your disappointment.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> When most people think about augmented reality,  they think about "Minority Report" and Tom Cruise  waving his hands in the air,  but augmented reality is not science fiction.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> Augmented reality is something that will happen  in our lifetime, and it will happen  because we have the tools to make it happen,  and people need to be aware of that,  because augmented reality will change our lives  just as much as the Internet and the cell phone.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Now how do we get to augmented reality?    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Step one is the step I'm wearing right now,  Google Glass.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> I'm sure many of you are familiar with Google Glass.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> What you may not be familiar with  is that Google Glass is a device  that will allow you to see what I see.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> It will allow you to experience what it is like  to be a professional athlete on the field.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Right now, the only way you can be on the field  is for me to try and describe it to you.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> I have to use words.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> I have to create a framework that you then fill in  with your imagination.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> With Google Glass, we can put that  underneath a helmet,  and we can get a sense of what it's like  to be running down the field at 100 miles an hour,  your blood pounding in your ears.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> You can get a sense of what it's like  to have a 250-pound man  sprinting at you  trying to decapitate you  with every ounce of his being.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> and it doesn't feel very good.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> Now, I have some footage to show you of what it's like  to wear Google Glass underneath the helmet  to give you a taste of that.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> Unfortunately, it's not NFL practice footage  because the NFL thinks emergent technology  is what happens when a submarine surfaces,  but —  — we do what we can.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> So let's pull up some video.    </seg>
<seg id="20">  Chris Kluwe: Go.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> Ugh, getting tackled sucks.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> Hold on, let's get a little closer.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> All right, ready?    </seg>
<seg id="24"> Go!    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Chris Kluwe: So as you can see,  small taste of what it's like to get tackled  on the football field  from the perspective of the tacklee.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Now, you may have noticed there are  some people missing there:  the rest of the team.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> We have some video of that  courtesy of the University of Washington.    </seg>
<seg id="28">  Quarterback: Hey, Mice 54! Mice 54!    </seg>
<seg id="29"> Blue 8! Blue 8! Go!    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Oh!    </seg>
<seg id="31"> CK: So again, this takes you a little bit closer  to what it's like to be on that field,  but this is nowhere what it's like  to be on the NFL.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> Fans want that experience.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Fans want to be on that field.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> They want to be their favorite players,  and they've already talked to me on YouTube,  they've talked to me on Twitter, saying,  "Hey, can you get this on a quarterback?    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Can you get this on a running back?    </seg>
<seg id="36"> We want that experience."    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Well, once we have that experience with GoPro  and Google Glass,  how do we make it more immersive?    </seg>
<seg id="38"> How do we take that next step?    </seg>
<seg id="39"> Well, we take that step  by going to something called the Oculus Rift,  which I'm sure many of you are also familiar with.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> The Oculus Rift has been described as one of  the most realistic virtual reality devices ever created,  and that is not empty hype.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> I'm going to show you why that is not empty hype  with this video.    </seg>
<seg id="42">  Man: Oh! Oh!    </seg>
<seg id="43"> No! No! No! I don't want to play anymore! No!    </seg>
<seg id="44"> Oh my God! Aaaah!    </seg>
<seg id="45"> CK: So that is the experience of a man  on a roller coaster  in fear of his life.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> What do you think that fan's experience  is going to be when we take the video footage  of an Adrian Peterson bursting through the line,  shedding a tackler with a stiff-arm  before sprinting in for a touchdown?    </seg>
<seg id="47"> What do you think that fan's experience  is going to be when he's Messi  sprinting down the pitch  putting the ball in the back of the net,  or Federer serving in Wimbledon?    </seg>
<seg id="48"> What do you think his experience is going to be  when he is going down the side of a mountain  at over 70 miles an hour  as an Olympic downhill skier?    </seg>
<seg id="49"> I think adult diaper sales may surge.    </seg>
<seg id="50">   But this is not yet augmented reality.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> This is only virtual reality, V.R.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> How do we get to augmented reality, A.R.?    </seg>
<seg id="53"> We get to augmented reality  when coaches and managers and owners  look at this information streaming in  that people want to see, and they say,  "How do we use this to make our teams better?    </seg>
<seg id="54"> How do we use this to win games?"    </seg>
<seg id="55"> Because teams always use technology to win games.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> They like winning. It makes them money.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> So a brief history of technology in the NFL.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> In 1965, the Baltimore Colts  put a wristband on their quarterback  to allow him to call plays quicker.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> They ended up winning a Super Bowl that year.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> Other teams followed suit.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> More people watched the game because it was more exciting.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> It was faster.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> In 1994, the NFL put helmet radios  into the helmets of the quarterbacks,  and later the defense.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> More people watched games because it was faster.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> It was more entertaining.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> In 2023, imagine you're a player  walking back to the huddle,  and you have your next play displayed  right in front of your face on your clear plastic visor  that you already wear right now.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> No more having to worry about forgetting plays.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> No more worrying about having to memorize your playbook.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> You just go out and react.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> And coaches really want this,  because missed assignments lose you games,  and coaches hate losing games.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> Losing games gets you fired as a coach.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> They don't want that.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> But augmented reality is not just  an enhanced playbook.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> Augmented reality is also a way to take all that data  and use it in real time  to enhance how you play the game.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> What would that be like?    </seg>
<seg id="76"> Well, a very simple setup would be a camera  on each corner of the stadium looking down,  giving you a bird's-eye view  of all the people down there.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> You also have information from helmet sensors  and accelerometers,  technology that's being worked on right now.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> You take all that information, and you stream it to your players.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> The good teams stream it in a way that the players can use.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> The bad ones have information overload.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> That determines good teams from bad.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> And now, your I.T. department  is just as important as your scouting department,  and data-mining is not for nerds anymore.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> It's also for jocks. Who knew?    </seg>
<seg id="84"> What would that look like on the field?    </seg>
<seg id="85"> Well, imagine you're the quarterback.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> You take the snap and you drop back.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> You're scanning downfield for an open receiver.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> All of a sudden, a bright flash  on the left side of your visor lets you know,  blind side linebacker is blitzing in.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> Normally, you wouldn't be able to see him,  but the augmented reality system lets you know.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> You step up into the pocket.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> Another flash alerts you to an open receiver.    </seg>
<seg id="92"> You throw the ball, but you're hit right as you throw.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> The ball comes off track.    </seg>
<seg id="94"> You don't know where it's going to land.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> However, on the receiver's visor,  he sees a patch of grass light up,  and he knows to readjust.    </seg>
<seg id="96"> He goes, catches the ball,  sprints in, touchdown.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> Crowd goes wild, and the fans are with him  every step of the way,  watching from every perspective.    </seg>
<seg id="98"> Now this is something that will create  massive excitement in the game.    </seg>
<seg id="99"> It will make tons of people watch,  because people want this experience.    </seg>
<seg id="100"> Fans want to be on the field.    </seg>
<seg id="101"> They want to be their favorite player.    </seg>
<seg id="102"> Augmented reality will be a part of sports,  because it's too profitable not to.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> But the question I ask you is,  is that's all that we're content to use augmented reality for?    </seg>
<seg id="104"> Are we going to use it solely for our panem,  our circenses, our entertainment as normal?    </seg>
<seg id="105"> Because I believe that we can use augmented reality  for something more.    </seg>
<seg id="106"> I believe we can use augmented reality  as a way to foster more empathy  within the human species itself,  by literally showing someone  what it looks like  to walk a mile in another person's shoes.    </seg>
<seg id="107"> We know what this technology is worth  to sports leagues.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> It's worth revenue, to the tune of billions of dollars a year.    </seg>
<seg id="109"> But what is this technology worth  to a teacher in a classroom  trying to show a bully  just how harmful his actions are  from the perspective of the victim?    </seg>
<seg id="110"> What is this technology worth  to a gay Ugandan or Russian  trying to show the world what it's like  living under persecution?    </seg>
<seg id="111"> What is this technology worth  to a Commander Hadfield or a Neil deGrasse Tyson  trying to inspire a generation of children  to think more about space and science  instead of quarterly reports and Kardashians?    </seg>
<seg id="112"> Ladies and gentlemen, augmented reality  is coming.    </seg>
<seg id="113"> The questions we ask, the choices we make,  and the challenges we face  are, as always, up to us.    </seg>
<seg id="114"> Thank you.    </seg>

<title>Kevin Briggs: The bridge between suicide and life</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> I recently retired  from the California Highway Patrol  after 23 years of service.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> The majority of those 23 years  was spent patrolling the southern end  of Marin County,  which includes the Golden Gate Bridge.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> The bridge is an iconic structure,  known worldwide  for its beautiful views of San Francisco,  the Pacific Ocean, and its inspiring architecture.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Unfortunately, it is also a magnet for suicide,  being one of the most utilized sites in the world.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Golden Gate Bridge opened in 1937.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Joseph Strauss, chief engineer in charge of building the bridge,  was quoted as saying,  "The bridge is practically suicide-proof.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Suicide from the bridge  is neither practical nor probable."    </seg>
<seg id="8"> But since its opening,  over 1,600 people have leapt to their death  from that bridge.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some believe that traveling  between the two towers  will lead you to another dimension --  this bridge has been romanticized as such —  that the fall from that  frees you from all your worries and grief,  and the waters below  will cleanse your soul.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> But let me tell you what actually occurs  when the bridge is used  as a means of suicide.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> After a free fall of four to five seconds,  the body strikes the water  at about 75 miles an hour.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> That impact shatters bones,  some of which then puncture vital organs.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Most die on impact.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> Those that don't  generally flail in the water helplessly,  and then drown.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> I don't think that those who contemplate  this method of suicide  realize how grisly a death that they will face.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> This is the cord.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> Except for around the two towers,  there is 32 inches of steel  paralleling the bridge.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> This is where most folks stand  before taking their lives.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> I can tell you from experience  that once the person is on that cord,  and at their darkest time,  it is very difficult to bring them back.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> I took this photo last year  as this young woman spoke to an officer  contemplating her life.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> I want to tell you very happily  that we were successful that day  in getting her back over the rail.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> When I first began working on the bridge,  we had no formal training.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> You struggled to funnel your way through these calls.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> This was not only a disservice  to those contemplating suicide,  but to the officers as well.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> We've come a long, long way since then.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Now, veteran officers and psychologists  train new officers.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> This is Jason Garber.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> I met Jason on July 22 of last year  when I get received a call  of a possible suicidal subject  sitting on the cord near midspan.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> I responded, and when I arrived,  I observed Jason  speaking to a Golden Gate Bridge officer.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Jason was just 32 years old  and had flown out here from New Jersey.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> As a matter of fact,  he had flown out here on two other occasions  from New Jersey  to attempt suicide on this bridge.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> After about an hour of speaking with Jason,  he asked us if we knew the story of Pandora's box.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> Recalling your Greek mythology,  Zeus created Pandora,  and sent her down to Earth with a box,  and told her, "Never, ever open that box."    </seg>
<seg id="34"> Well one day, curiosity got the better of Pandora,  and she did open the box.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Out flew plagues, sorrows,  and all sorts of evils against man.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> The only good thing in the box was hope.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Jason then asked us,  "What happens when you open the box  and hope isn't there?"    </seg>
<seg id="38"> He paused a few moments,  leaned to his right,  and was gone.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> This kind, intelligent young man from New Jersey  had just committed suicide.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> I spoke with Jason's parents that evening,  and I suppose that, when I was speaking with them,  that I didn't sound as if I was doing very well,  because that very next day,  their family rabbi called to check on me.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> Jason's parents had asked him to do so.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> The collateral damage of suicide  affects so many people.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> I pose these questions to you:  What would you do if your family member,  friend or loved one was suicidal?    </seg>
<seg id="44"> What would you say?    </seg>
<seg id="45"> Would you know what to say?    </seg>
<seg id="46"> In my experience, it's not just the talking that you do,  but the listening.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> Listen to understand.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> Don't argue, blame,  or tell the person you know how they feel,  because you probably don't.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> By just being there,  you may just be the turning point that they need.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> If you think someone is suicidal,  don't be afraid to confront them and ask the question.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> One way of asking them the question is like this:  "Others in similar circumstances  have thought about ending their life;  have you had these thoughts?"    </seg>
<seg id="52"> may just save their life and be the turning point for them.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Some other signs to look for:  hopelessness, believing that things are terrible  and never going to get better;  helplessness, believing that there is nothing  that you can do about it;  recent social withdrawal;  and a loss of interest in life.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago,  and I received an email from a lady  that I'd like to read you her letter.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> She lost her son on January 19 of this year,  and she wrote this me this email  just a couple of days ago,  and it's with her permission and blessing  that I read this to you.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> "Hi, Kevin. I imagine you're at the TED Conference.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> That must be quite the experience to be there.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> I'm thinking I should go walk the bridge this weekend.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> Just wanted to drop you a note.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> Hope you get the word out to many people  and they go home talking about it  to their friends who tell their friends, etc.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> I'm still pretty numb,  but noticing more moments of really realizing  Mike isn't coming home.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> Mike was driving from Petaluma to San Francisco  to watch the 49ers game with his father  on January 19.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> He never made it there.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> I called Petaluma police  and reported him missing that evening.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> The next morning,  two officers came to my home  and reported that Mike's car was down at the bridge.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> A witness had observed him jumping off the bridge  at 1:58 p.m. the previous day.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> Thanks so much  for standing up for those  who may be only temporarily too weak  to stand for themselves.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> Who hasn't been low before  without suffering from a true mental illness?    </seg>
<seg id="69"> It shouldn't be so easy to end it.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> My prayers are with you for your fight.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> The GGB, Golden Gate Bridge,  is supposed to be a passage across  our beautiful bay,  not a graveyard.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> Good luck this week. Vicky."    </seg>
<seg id="73"> I can't imagine the courage it takes for her  to go down to that bridge and walk the path  that her son took that day,  and also the courage just to carry on.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> I'd like to introduce you to a man  I refer to as hope and courage.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> On March 11 of 2005,  I responded to a radio call of a possible  suicidal subject on the bridge sidewalk  near the north tower.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> I rode my motorcycle down the sidewalk  and observed this man, Kevin Berthia,  standing on the sidewalk.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> When he saw me, he immediately traversed  that pedestrian rail,  and stood on that small pipe  which goes around the tower.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> For the next hour and a half,  I listened as Kevin spoke about  his depression and hopelessness.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> Kevin decided on his own that day  to come back over that rail  and give life another chance.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> When Kevin came back over,  I congratulated him.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> "This is a new beginning, a new life."    </seg>
<seg id="82"> But I asked him, "What was it  that made you come back  and give hope and life another chance?"    </seg>
<seg id="83"> And you know what he told me?    </seg>
<seg id="84"> He said, "You listened.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> You let me speak, and you just listened."    </seg>
<seg id="86"> Shortly after this incident,  I received a letter from Kevin's mother,  and I have that letter with me,  and I'd like to read it to you.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> "Dear Mr. Briggs,  Nothing will erase the events of March 11,  but you are one of the reasons Kevin is still with us.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> I truly believe Kevin was crying out for help.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> He has been diagnosed with a mental illness  for which he has been properly medicated.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> I adopted Kevin when he was only six months old,  completely unaware of any hereditary traits,  but, thank God, now we know.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> Kevin is straight, as he says.    </seg>
<seg id="92"> We truly thank God for you.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> Sincerely indebted to you,  Narvella Berthia."    </seg>
<seg id="94"> And on the bottom she writes,  "P.S. When I visited San Francisco General Hospital that evening,  you were listed as the patient.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> Boy, did I have to straighten that one out."    </seg>
<seg id="96"> Today, Kevin is a loving father  and contributing member of society.    </seg>
<seg id="97"> He speaks openly  about the events that day and his depression  in the hopes that his story  will inspire others.    </seg>
<seg id="98"> Suicide is not just something I've encountered on the job.    </seg>
<seg id="99"> It's personal.    </seg>
<seg id="100"> My grandfather committed suicide by poisoning.    </seg>
<seg id="101"> That act, although ending his own pain,  robbed me from ever getting to know him.    </seg>
<seg id="102"> This is what suicide does.    </seg>
<seg id="103"> For most suicidal folks,  or those contemplating suicide,  they wouldn't think of hurting another person.    </seg>
<seg id="104"> They just want their own pain to end.    </seg>
<seg id="105"> Typically, this is accomplished in just three ways:  sleep, drugs or alcohol, or death.    </seg>
<seg id="106"> In my career, I've responded to  and been involved in hundreds  of mental illness and suicide calls  around the bridge.    </seg>
<seg id="107"> Of those incidents I've been directly involved with,  I've only lost two,  but that's two too many.    </seg>
<seg id="108"> One was Jason.    </seg>
<seg id="109"> The other was a man I spoke to  for about an hour.    </seg>
<seg id="110"> During that time, he shook my hand  on three occasions.    </seg>
<seg id="111"> On that final handshake,  he looked at me, and he said,  "Kevin, I'm sorry, but I have to go."    </seg>
<seg id="112"> And he leapt.    </seg>
<seg id="113"> Horrible, absolutely horrible.    </seg>
<seg id="114"> I do want to tell you, though,  the vast majority of folks  that we do get to contact on that bridge  do not commit suicide.    </seg>
<seg id="115"> Additionally, that very few  who have jumped off the bridge and lived  and can talk about it,  that one to two percent,  most of those folks have said  that the second that they let go of that rail,  they knew that they had made a mistake  and they wanted to live.    </seg>
<seg id="116"> I tell people, the bridge not only connects  Marin to San Francisco,  but people together also.    </seg>
<seg id="117"> That connection, or bridge that we make,  is something that each and every one of us  should strive to do.    </seg>
<seg id="118"> Suicide is preventable.    </seg>
<seg id="119"> There is help. There is hope.    </seg>
<seg id="120"> Thank you very much.    </seg>

<title>Geena Rocero: Why I must come out</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> The world makes you something that you're not,  but you know inside what you are,  and that question burns in your heart:  How will you become that?    </seg>
<seg id="2"> I may be somewhat unique in this,  but I am not alone,  not alone at all.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> So when I became a fashion model,  I felt that I'd finally achieved the dream  that I'd always wanted since I was a young child.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> My outside self finally matched my inner truth,  my inner self.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> For complicated reasons which I'll get to later,  when I look at this picture,  at that time I felt like, Geena, you've done it,  you've made it,  you have arrived.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> But this past October,  I realized that I'm only just beginning.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> All of us are put in boxes by our family,  by our religion,  by our society,  our moment in history,  even our own bodies.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> Some people have the courage to break free,  not to accept the limitations imposed by the color of their skin  or by the beliefs of those that surround them.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> Those people are always the threat  to the status quo,  to what is considered acceptable.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> In my case, for the last nine years,  some of my neighbors,  some of my friends, colleagues, even my agent,  did not know about my history.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> I think, in mystery, this is called the reveal.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> Here is mine.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> I was assigned boy at birth  based on the appearance of my genitalia.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> I remember when I was five years old  in the Philippines walking around our house,  I would always wear this t-shirt on my head.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> And my mom asked me,  "How come you always wear that t-shirt on your head?"    </seg>
<seg id="16"> I said, "Mom, this is my hair. I'm a girl."    </seg>
<seg id="17"> I knew then how to self-identify.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> Gender has always been considered a fact,  immutable,  but we now know it's actually more fluid,  complex and mysterious.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> Because of my success, I never had the courage  to share my story,  not because I thought what I am is wrong,  but because of how the world treats those of us  who wish to break free.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> Every day,  I am so grateful because I am a woman.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> I have a mom and dad and family  who accepted me for who I am.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> Many are not so fortunate.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> There's a long tradition in Asian culture  that celebrates the fluid mystery of gender.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> There is a Buddhist goddess of compassion.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> There is a Hindu goddess, hijra goddess.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> So when I was eight years old,  I was at a fiesta in the Philippines celebrating  these mysteries.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> I was in front of the stage,  and I remember, out comes this beautiful woman  right in front of me,  and I remember that moment something hit me:  That is the kind of woman I would like to be.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> So when I was 15 years old,  still dressing as a boy,  I met this woman named T.L.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> She is a transgender beauty pageant manager.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> That night she asked me,  "How come you are not joining the beauty pageant?"    </seg>
<seg id="31"> She convinced me that if I joined  that she would take care of the registration fee  and the garments,  and that night,  I won best in swimsuit  and best in long gown  and placed second runner up  among 40-plus candidates.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> That moment changed my life.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> All of a sudden, I was introduced  to the world of beauty pageants.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> Not a lot of people could say that your first job  is a pageant queen for transgender women,  but I'll take it.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> So from 15 to 17 years old, I joined  the most prestigious pageant  to the pageant where it's at the back of the truck, literally,  or sometimes it would be a pavement next to a rice field,  and when it rains --  it rains a lot in the Philippines --  the organizers would have to move it  inside someone's house.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> I also experienced the goodness of strangers,  especially when we would travel  in remote provinces in the Philippines.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> But most importantly, I met  some of my best friends in that community.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> In 2001,  my mom, who had moved to San Francisco,  called me and told me that my green card petition came through,  that I could now move to the United States.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> I resisted it.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> I told my mom, "Mom, I'm having fun.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> I'm here with my friends,  I love traveling, being a beauty pageant queen."    </seg>
<seg id="42"> But then two weeks later she called me, she said,  "Did you know that if you move to the United States  you could change your name and gender marker?"    </seg>
<seg id="43"> That was all I needed to hear.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> My mom also told me to put two E's  in the spelling of my name.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> She also came with me when I had my surgery  in Thailand at 19 years old.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> It's interesting, in some of the most rural cities in Thailand,  they perform some of the most prestigious,  safe and sophisticated surgery.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> At that time in the United States, you needed to have surgery  before you could change your name and gender marker.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> So in 2001, I moved to San Francisco,  and I remember looking at my California driver's license  with the name Geena  and gender marker F.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> That was a powerful moment.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> For some people,  their I.D. is their license to drive  or even to get a drink,  but for me, that was my license to live,  to feel dignified.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> All of a sudden, my fears were minimized.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> I felt that I could conquer my dream  and move to New York and be a model.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Many are not so fortunate.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> I think of this woman named Islan Nettles.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> She's from New York, she's a young woman  who was courageously living her truth,  but hatred ended her life.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> For most of my community,  this is the reality in which we live.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> Our suicide rate is nine times higher  than that of the general population.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> Every November 20,  we have a global vigil  for Transgender Day of Remembrance.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> I'm here at this stage  because it's a long history of people who fought  and stood up for injustice.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> Today, this very moment,  is my real coming out.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> I could no longer live my truth  for and by myself.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> I want to do my best to help others  live their truth without shame and terror.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> I am here, exposed,  so that one day there will never be a need  for a November 20 vigil.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> My deepest truth allowed me to accept who I am.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> Will you?    </seg>
<seg id="67"> Thank you very much.    </seg>
<seg id="68">   Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.   Kathryn Schulz: Geena, one quick question for you.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> I'm wondering what you would say,  especially to parents,  but in a more broad way, to friends,  to family, to anyone who finds themselves  encountering a child or a person  who is struggling with and uncomfortable with  a gender that's being assigned them,  to the family members of that person  to help them become good and caring and kind  family members to them?    </seg>
<seg id="70"> Geena Rocero: Sure. Well, first, really, I'm so blessed.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> The support system, with my mom especially,  and my family, that in itself  is just so powerful.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> I remember every time I would coach  young trans women, I would mentor them,  and sometimes when they would call me  and tell me that their parents can't accept it,  I would pick up that phone call and tell my mom,  "Mom, can you call this woman?"    </seg>
<seg id="73"> And sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, so —  But it's just, gender identity  is in the core of our being, right?    </seg>
<seg id="74"> I mean, we're all assigned gender at birth,  so what I'm trying to do  is to have this conversation that  sometimes that gender assignment doesn't match,  and there should be a space  that would allow people to self-identify,  and that's a conversation that we should have  with parents, with colleagues.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> The transgender movement,  to compare to how the gay movement started.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> There's still a lot of work that needs to be done.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> There should be an understanding.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> There should be a space of curiosity  and asking questions,  and I hope all of you guys will be my allies.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> KS: Thank you. That was so lovely. GR: Thank you.    </seg>

<description>TED Talk Subtitles and Transcript: Pakistani educator Ziauddin Yousafzai reminds the world of a simple truth that many don’t want to hear: Women and men deserve equal opportunities for education, autonomy, an independent identity. He tells stories from his own life and the life of his daughter, Malala, who was shot by the Taliban in 2012 simply for daring to go to school. "Why is my daughter so strong?” Yousafzai asks. “Because I didn’t clip her wings."</description>

<title>Ziauddin Yousafzai: My daughter, Malala</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> In many patriarchal societies and tribal societies,  fathers are usually known by their sons,  but I'm one of the few fathers  who is known by his daughter,  and I am proud of it.    </seg>
<seg id="2">   Malala started her campaign for education  and stood for her rights in 2007,  and when her efforts were honored in 2011,  and she was given the national youth peace prize,  and she became a very famous,  very popular young girl of her country.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Before that, she was my daughter,  but now I am her father.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> Ladies and gentlemen,  if we glance to human history,  the story of women  is the story of injustice,  inequality,  violence and exploitation.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> You see,  in patriarchal societies,  right from the very beginning,  when a girl is born,  her birth is not celebrated.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> She is not welcomed,  neither by father nor by mother.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> The neighborhood comes  and commiserates with the mother,  and nobody congratulates the father.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And a mother is very uncomfortable  for having a girl child.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> When she gives birth to the first girl child,  first daughter, she is sad.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> When she gives birth to the second daughter,  she is shocked,  and in the expectation of a son,  when she gives birth to a third daughter,  she feels guilty like a criminal.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Not only the mother suffers,  but the daughter, the newly born daughter,  when she grows old,  she suffers too.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> At the age of five,  while she should be going to school,  she stays at home  and her brothers are admitted in a school.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> Until the age of 12, somehow,  she has a good life.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> She can have fun.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> She can play with her friends in the streets,  and she can move around in the streets  like a butterfly.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> But when she enters her teens,  when she becomes 13 years old,  she is forbidden to go out of her home  without a male escort.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> She is confined under the four walls of her home.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> She is no more a free individual.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> She becomes the so-called honor  of her father and of her brothers  and of her family,  and if she transgresses the code of that so-called honor,  she could even be killed.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> And it is also interesting that this so-called  code of honor,  it does not only affect the life of a girl,  of the male members of the family.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> I know a family of seven sisters and one brother,  and that one brother,  he has migrated to the Gulf countries,  to earn a living for his seven sisters  and parents,  because he thinks that it will be humiliating  if his seven sisters learn a skill  and they go out of the home  and earn some livelihood.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> So this brother,  he sacrifices the joys of his life  and the happiness of his sisters  at the altar of so-called honor.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> And there is one more norm  of the patriarchal societies  that is called obedience.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> A good girl is supposed to be  very quiet, very humble  and very submissive.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> It is the criteria.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> The role model good girl should be very quiet.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> She is supposed to be silent  and she is supposed to accept the decisions  of her father and mother  and the decisions of elders,  even if she does not like them.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> If she is married to a man she doesn't like  or if she is married to an old man,  she has to accept,  because she does not want to be dubbed  as disobedient.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> If she is married very early,  she has to accept.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Otherwise, she will be called disobedient.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> And what happens at the end?    </seg>
<seg id="32"> In the words of a poetess,  she is wedded, bedded,  and then she gives birth to more sons and daughters.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> And it is the irony of the situation  that this mother,  she teaches the same lesson of obedience  to her daughter  and the same lesson of honor to her sons.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> And this vicious cycle goes on, goes on.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Ladies and gentlemen,  this plight of millions of women  could be changed  if we think differently,  if women and men think differently,  if men and women in the tribal and patriarchal societies  in the developing countries, if they can break a few norms  of family and society,  if they can abolish the discriminatory laws  of the systems in their states,  which go against the basic human rights  of the women.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> Dear brothers and sisters, when Malala was born,  and for the first time,  believe me,  I don't like newborn children, to be honest,  but when I went and I looked into her eyes,  believe me,  I got extremely honored.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> And long before she was born,  I thought about her name,  and I was fascinated with a heroic  legendary freedom fighter in Afghanistan.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Her name was Malalai of Maiwand,  and I named my daughter after her.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> A few days after Malala was born,  my daughter was born,  my cousin came --  and it was a coincidence --  he came to my home  and he brought a family tree,  a family tree of the Yousafzai family,  and when I looked at the family tree,  it traced back to 300 years of our ancestors.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> But when I looked, all were men,  and I picked my pen,  drew a line from my name,  and wrote, "Malala."    </seg>
<seg id="41"> And when she grow old,  when she was four and a half years old,  I admitted her in my school.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> You will be asking, then, why should I mention about  the admission of a girl in a school?    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Yes, I must mention it.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> It may be taken for granted in Canada,  in America, in many developed countries,  but in poor countries,  in patriarchal societies, in tribal societies,  it's a big event for the life of girl.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> Enrollment in a school means  recognition of her identity and her name.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> Admission in a school means  that she has entered the world of dreams  and aspirations  where she can explore her potentials  for her future life.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> I have five sisters,  and none of them could go to school,  and you will be astonished,  two weeks before,  when I was filling out the Canadian visa form,  and I was filling out the family part of the form,  I could not recall  the surnames of some of my sisters.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> And the reason was  that I have never, never seen the names  of my sisters written on any document.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> That was the reason that  I valued my daughter.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> What my father could not give to my sisters  and to his daughters,  I thought I must change it.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> I used to appreciate the intelligence  and the brilliance of my daughter.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> I encouraged her to sit with me  I encouraged her to go with me to different meetings.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> And all these good values,  I tried to inculcate in her personality.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> And this was not only she, only Malala.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> I imparted all these good values  to my school, girl students and boy students as well.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> I used education for emancipation.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> I taught my girls,  I taught my girl students,  to unlearn the lesson of obedience.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> I taught my boy students  to unlearn the lesson of so-called pseudo-honor.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> Dear brothers and sisters,  we were striving for more rights for women,  and we were struggling to have more,  more and more space for the women in society.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> But we came across a new phenomenon.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> It was lethal to human rights  and particularly to women's rights.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> It was called Talibanization.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> It means a complete negation  of women's participation  in all political, economical and social activities.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> Hundreds of schools were lost.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> Girls were prohibited from going to school.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> Women were forced to wear veils  and they were stopped from going to the markets.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> Musicians were silenced,  girls were flogged  and singers were killed.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> Millions were suffering,  but few spoke,  and it was the most scary thing  when you have all around such people  who kill and who flog,  and you speak for your rights.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> It's really the most scary thing.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> At the age of 10,  Malala stood, and she stood for the right  of education.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> She wrote a diary for the BBC blog,  she volunteered herself  for the New York Times documentaries,  and she spoke from every platform she could.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> And her voice was the most powerful voice.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> It spread like a crescendo all around the world.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> And that was the reason the Taliban  could not tolerate her campaign,  and on October 9 2012,  she was shot in the head at point blank range.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> It was a doomsday for my family and for me.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> The world turned into a big black hole.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> While my daughter was  on the verge of life and death,  I whispered into the ears of my wife,  "Should I be blamed for what happened  to my daughter and your daughter?"    </seg>
<seg id="78"> And she abruptly told me,  "Please don't blame yourself.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> You stood for the right cause.    </seg>
<seg id="80"> You put your life at stake  for the cause of truth,  for the cause of peace,  and for the cause of education,  and your daughter in inspired from you  and she joined you.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> You both were on the right path  and God will protect her."    </seg>
<seg id="82"> These few words meant a lot to me,  and I didn't ask this question again.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> When Malala was in the hospital,  and she was going through the severe pains  and she had had severe headaches  because her facial nerve was cut down,  I used to see a dark shadow  spreading on the face of my wife.    </seg>
<seg id="84"> But my daughter never complained.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> She used to tell us,  "I'm fine with my crooked smile  and with my numbness in my face.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> I'll be okay. Please don't worry."    </seg>
<seg id="87"> She was a solace for us,  and she consoled us.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> Dear brothers and sisters,  we learned from her how to be resilient  in the most difficult times,  and I'm glad to share with you  that despite being an icon  for the rights of children and women,  she is like any 16-year old girl.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> She cries when her homework is incomplete.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> She quarrels with her brothers,  and I am very happy for that.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> People ask me,  what special is in my mentorship  which has made Malala so bold  and so courageous and so vocal and poised?    </seg>
<seg id="92"> I tell them, don't ask me what I did.    </seg>
<seg id="93"> Ask me what I did not do.    </seg>
<seg id="94"> I did not clip her wings, and that's all.    </seg>
<seg id="95"> Thank you very much.    </seg>
<seg id="96">   Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.     </seg>

<title>Mary Lou Jepsen: Could future devices read images from our brains?</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> I had brain surgery 18 years ago,  and since that time, brain science has become  a personal passion of mine.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> I'm actually an engineer.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> And first let me say, I recently joined  Google's Moonshot group,  where I had a division,  the display division in Google X,  and the brain science work I'm speaking about today  is work I did before I joined Google  and on the side outside of Google.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> So that said, there's a stigma  when you have brain surgery.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> Are you still smart or not?    </seg>
<seg id="6"> And if not, can you make yourself smart again?    </seg>
<seg id="7"> After my neurosurgery,  part of my brain was missing,  and I had to deal with that.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> It wasn't the grey matter, but it was the gooey part dead center  that makes key hormones and neurotransmitters.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> Immediately after my surgery,  a dozen powerful chemicals to take each day,  because if I just took nothing,  I would die within hours.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> Every day now for 18 years -- every single day --  I've had to try to decide the combinations  and mixtures of chemicals,  and try to get them, to stay alive.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> There have been several close calls.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> But luckily, I'm an experimentalist at heart,  so I decided I would experiment  to try to find more optimal dosages  because there really isn't a clear road map  on this that's detailed.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> I began to try different mixtures,  and I was blown away by how  tiny changes in dosages  dramatically changed my sense of self,  my sense of who I was, my thinking,  my behavior towards people.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> One particularly dramatic case:  for a couple months I actually tried dosages  and chemicals typical of a man in his early 20s,  and I was blown away by how my thoughts changed.    </seg>
<seg id="15">   I was angry all the time,  I thought about sex constantly,  and I thought I was the smartest person  in the entire world, and  ——  of course over the years I'd met guys kind of like that,  or maybe kind of toned-down versions of that.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> I was kind of extreme.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> But to me, the surprise was,  I wasn't trying to be arrogant.    </seg>
<seg id="18"> I was actually trying,  with a little bit of insecurity,  to actually fix a problem in front of me,  and it just didn't come out that way.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> So I couldn't handle it.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> I changed my dosages.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> But that experience, I think, gave me  a new appreciation for men  and what they might walk through,  and I've gotten along with men  a lot better since then.    </seg>
<seg id="22"> What I was trying to do  with tuning these hormones  and neurotransmitters and so forth  was to try to get my intelligence back  after my illness and surgery,  my creative thought, my idea flow.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> And I think mostly in images,  and so for me that became a key metric --  how to get these mental images  that I use as a way of rapid prototyping,  if you will, my ideas,  trying on different new ideas for size,  playing out scenarios.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> This kind of thinking isn't new.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> Philiosophers like Hume and Descartes and Hobbes  saw things similarly.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> They thought that mental images and ideas  were actually the same thing.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> There are those today that dispute that,  and lots of debates about how the mind works,  but for me it's simple:  Mental images, for most of us,  are central in inventive and creative thinking.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> So after several years,  I tuned myself up and I have lots of great,  really vivid mental images with a lot of sophistication  and the analytical backbone behind them.    </seg>
<seg id="29"> And so now I'm working on,  how can I get these mental images in my mind  out to my computer screen faster?    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Can you imagine, if you will,  a movie director being able to use  her imagination alone to direct the world in front of her?    </seg>
<seg id="31"> Or a musician to get the music out of his head?    </seg>
<seg id="32"> There are incredible possibilities with this  as a way for creative people  to share at light speed.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> And the truth is, the remaining bottleneck  in being able to do this  is just upping the resolution of brain scan systems.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting there  by sharing with you two recent experiments  from two top neuroscience groups.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Both used fMRI technology --  functional magnetic resonance imaging technology --  to image the brain,  and here is a brain scan set from Giorgio Ganis  and his colleagues at Harvard.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> And the left-hand column shows a brain scan  of a person looking at an image.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> The middle column shows the brainscan  of that same individual  imagining, seeing that same image.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> And the right column was created  by subtracting the middle column from the left column,  showing the difference to be nearly zero.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> This was repeated on lots of different individuals  with lots of different images,  always with a similar result.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> The difference between seeing an image  and imagining seeing that same image  is next to nothing.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> Next let me share with you one other experiment,  this from Jack Gallant's lab at Cal Berkeley.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> They've been able to decode brainwaves  into recognizable visual fields.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> So let me set this up for you.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> In this experiment, individuals were shown  hundreds of hours of YouTube videos  while scans were made of their brains  to create a large library of their brain reacting  to video sequences.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> Then a new movie was shown with new images,  new people, new animals in it,  and a new scan set was recorded.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> The computer, using brain scan data alone,  decoded that new brain scan  to show what it thought the individual was actually seeing.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> On the right-hand side, you see the computer's guess,  and on the left-hand side, the presented clip.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> This is the jaw-dropper.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> We are so close to being able to do this.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> We just need to up the resolution.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> And now remember that when you see an image  versus when you imagine that same image,  it creates the same brain scan.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> So this was done with the highest-resolution  brain scan systems available today,  and their resolution has increased really  about a thousandfold in the last several years.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> Next we need to increase the resolution  another thousandfold  to get a deeper glimpse.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> How do we do that?    </seg>
<seg id="55"> There's a lot of techniques in this approach.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> One way is to crack open your skull and put in electrodes.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> I'm not for that.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> There's a lot of new imaging techniques  being proposed, some even by me,  but given the recent success of MRI,  first we need to ask the question,  is it the end of the road with this technology?    </seg>
<seg id="59"> Conventional wisdom says the only way  to get higher resolution is with bigger magnets,  but at this point bigger magnets  only offer incremental resolution improvements,  not the thousandfold we need.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> I'm putting forward an idea:  instead of bigger magnets,  let's make better magnets.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> There's some new technology breakthroughs  when applied to magnetic structures  that have created a whole new class of magnets,  and with these magnets, we can lay down  very fine detailed magnetic field patterns  throughout the brain,  and using those, we can actually create  holographic-like interference structures  to get precision control over many patterns,  as is shown here by shifting things.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> We can create much more complicated structures  with slightly different arrangements,  kind of like making Spirograph.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> So why does that matter?    </seg>
<seg id="64"> A lot of effort in MRI over the years  has gone into making really big,  really huge magnets, right?    </seg>
<seg id="65"> But yet most of the recent advances  in resolution have actually come from  ingeniously clever encoding and decoding solutions  in the F.M. radio frequency transmitters and receivers  in the MRI systems.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> Let's also, instead of a uniform magnetic field,  put down structured magnetic patterns  in addition to the F.M. radio frequencies.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> So by combining the magnetics patterns  with the patterns in the F.M. radio frequencies  processing which can massively increase  the information that we can extract in a single scan.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> And on top of that, we can then layer  our ever-growing knowledge of brain structure and memory  to create a thousandfold increase that we need.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> And using fMRI, we should be able to measure  not just oxygenated blood flow,  but the hormones and neurotransmitters I've talked about  and maybe even the direct neural activity,  which is the dream.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> We're going to be able to dump our ideas  directly to digital media.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> Could you imagine if we could leapfrog language  and communicate directly with human thought?    </seg>
<seg id="72"> What would we be capable of then?    </seg>
<seg id="73"> And how will we learn to deal  with the truths of unfiltered human thought?    </seg>
<seg id="74"> You think the Internet was big.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> These are huge questions.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> It might be irresistible as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication skills.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> And indeed, this very same tool  may prove to lead to the cure  for Alzheimer's and similar diseases.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> We have little option but to open this door.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> Regardless, pick a year --  will it happen in five years or 15 years?    </seg>
<seg id="80"> It's hard to imagine it taking much longer.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> We need to learn how to take this step together.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> Thank you.    </seg>

<title>Ash Beckham: We're all hiding something. Let's find the courage to open up</title>

<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> I'm going to talk to you tonight  about coming out of the closet,  and not in the traditional sense,  not just the gay closet.    </seg>
<seg id="2"> I think we all have closets.    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Your closet may be telling someone  you love her for the first time,  or telling someone that you're pregnant,  or telling someone you have cancer,  or any of the other hard conversations  we have throughout our lives.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> All a closet is is a hard conversation,  and although our topics may vary tremendously,  the experience of being in  and coming out of the closet is universal.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> It is scary, and we hate it, and it needs to be done.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Several years ago,  I was working at the South Side Walnut Cafe,  a local diner in town,  and during my time there I would go through phases  of militant lesbian intensity:  not shaving my armpits,  quoting Ani DiFranco lyrics as gospel.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> And depending on the bagginess of my cargo shorts  and how recently I had shaved my head,  the question would often be sprung on me,  usually by a little kid:  "Um, are you a boy or are you a girl?"    </seg>
<seg id="8"> And there would be an awkward silence at the table.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> I'd clench my jaw a little tighter,  hold my coffee pot with a little more vengeance.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> The dad would awkwardly shuffle his newspaper  and the mom would shoot a chilling stare at her kid.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> But I would say nothing,  and I would seethe inside.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> And it got to the point where every time I walked up  to a table that had a kid anywhere between three and 10 years old, I was ready to fight.    </seg>
<seg id="13">   And that is a terrible feeling.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> So I promised myself, the next time, I would say something.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> I would have that hard conversation.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> So within a matter of weeks, it happens again.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Are you a boy or are you a girl?"    </seg>
<seg id="18"> Familiar silence, but this time I'm ready,  and I am about to go all Women's Studies 101  on this table.   I've got my Betty Friedan quotes.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> I've got my Gloria Steinem quotes.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> I've even got this little bit from "Vagina Monologues" I'm going to do.    </seg>
<seg id="21"> So I take a deep breath and I look down  and staring back at me is a four-year-old girl in a pink dress,  not a challenge to a feminist duel,  just a kid with a question:  "Are you a boy or are you a girl?"    </seg>
<seg id="22"> So I take another deep breath,  squat down to next to her, and say,  "Hey, I know it's kind of confusing.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> My hair is short like a boy's,  and I wear boy's clothes, but I'm a girl,  and you know how sometimes you like to wear a pink dress,  and sometimes you like to wear your comfy jammies?    </seg>
<seg id="24"> Well, I'm more of a comfy jammies kind of girl."    </seg>
<seg id="25"> And this kid looks me dead in the eye,  without missing a beat, and says,  "My favorite pajamas are purple with fish.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Can I get a pancake, please?"    </seg>
<seg id="27">   And that was it. Just, "Oh, okay. You're a girl.    </seg>
<seg id="28"> How about that pancake?"    </seg>
<seg id="29"> It was the easiest hard conversation  And why? Because Pancake Girl and I,  we were both real with each other.    </seg>
<seg id="30"> So like many of us,  I've lived in a few closets in my life, and yeah,  most often, my walls happened to be rainbow.    </seg>
<seg id="31"> But inside, in the dark,  you can't tell what color the walls are.    </seg>
<seg id="32"> You just know what it feels like to live in a closet.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> So really, my closet is no different than yours  or yours or yours.    </seg>
<seg id="34"> Sure, I'll give you 100 reasons  why coming out of my closet was harder than coming out of yours,  but here's the thing: Hard is not relative.    </seg>
<seg id="35"> Hard is hard.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> Who can tell me that explaining to someone you've just declared bankruptcy  is harder than telling someone you just cheated on them?    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Who can tell me that his coming out story  is harder than telling your five-year-old you're getting a divorce?    </seg>
<seg id="38"> There is no harder, there is just hard.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> We need to stop ranking our hard against everyone else's hard  to make us feel better or worse about our closets  and just commiserate on the fact that we all have hard.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> At some point in our lives, we all live in closets,  and they may feel safe,  or at least safer than what lies on the other side of that door.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> But I am here to tell you,  no matter what your walls are made of,  a closet is no place for a person to live.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> Thanks.   So imagine yourself 20 years ago.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> Me, I had a ponytail, a strapless dress,  and high-heeled shoes.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> I was not the militant lesbian  ready to fight any four-year-old that walked into the cafe.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> I was frozen by fear, curled up in the corner  clutching my gay grenade,  and moving one muscle is the scariest thing  I have ever done.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> My family, my friends, complete strangers --  I had spent my entire life  trying to not disappoint these people,  and now I was turning the world upside down on purpose.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> I was burning the pages of the script  we had all followed for so long,  but if you do not throw that grenade, it will kill you.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> One of my most memorable grenade tosses  was at my sister's wedding.    </seg>
<seg id="49">   It was the first time that many in attendance  knew I was gay, so in doing my maid of honor duties,  in my black dress and heels,  I walked around to tables  and finally landed on a table of my parents' friends,  folks that had known me for years.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> And after a little small talk, one of the women shouted out,  "I love Nathan Lane!"    </seg>
<seg id="51"> And the battle of gay relatability had begun.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> "Ash, have you ever been to the Castro?"    </seg>
<seg id="53"> "Well, yeah, actually, we have friends in San Francisco."    </seg>
<seg id="54"> "Well, we've never been there but we've heard it's fabulous."    </seg>
<seg id="55"> "Ash, do you know my hairdresser Antonio?    </seg>
<seg id="56"> He's really good and he has never talked about a girlfriend."    </seg>
<seg id="57"> "Ash, what's your favorite TV show?    </seg>
<seg id="58"> Our favorite TV show? Favorite: Will &amp; Grace.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> And you know who we love? Jack.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> Jack is our favorite."    </seg>
<seg id="61"> And then one woman, stumped  but wanting so desperately to show her support,  to let me know she was on my side,  she finally blurted out,  "Well, sometimes my husband wears pink shirts."    </seg>
<seg id="62">   And I had a choice in that moment,  as all grenade throwers do.    </seg>
<seg id="63"> I could go back to my girlfriend and my gay-loving table  and mock their responses,  chastise their unworldliness and their inability  to jump through the politically correct gay hoops I had brought with me,  or I could empathize with them  and realize that that was maybe one of the hardest things they had ever done,  that starting and having that conversation  was them coming out of their closets.    </seg>
<seg id="64"> Sure, it would have been easy to point out where they felt short.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> It's a lot harder to meet them where they are  and acknowledge the fact that they were trying.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> And what else can you ask someone to do but try?    </seg>
<seg id="67"> If you're going to be real with someone,  you gotta be ready for real in return.    </seg>
<seg id="68"> So hard conversations are still not my strong suit.    </seg>
<seg id="69"> Ask anybody I have ever dated.    </seg>
<seg id="70"> But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call  the three Pancake Girl principles.    </seg>
<seg id="71"> Now, please view this through gay-colored lenses,  but know what it takes to come out of any closet  is essentially the same.    </seg>
<seg id="72"> Number one: Be authentic.    </seg>
<seg id="73"> Take the armor off. Be yourself.    </seg>
<seg id="74"> That kid in the cafe had no armor,  but I was ready for battle.    </seg>
<seg id="75"> If you want someone to be real with you,  they need to know that you bleed too.    </seg>
<seg id="76"> Number two: Be direct. Just say it. Rip the Band-Aid off.    </seg>
<seg id="77"> If you know you are gay, just say it.    </seg>
<seg id="78"> If you tell your parents you might be gay,  they will hold out hope that this will change.    </seg>
<seg id="79"> Do not give them that sense of false hope.    </seg>
<seg id="80">   And number three, and most important --    Be unapologetic.    </seg>
<seg id="81"> You are speaking your truth.    </seg>
<seg id="82"> Never apologize for that.    </seg>
<seg id="83"> And some folks may have gotten hurt along the way,  so sure, apologize for what you've done,  but never apologize for who you are.    </seg>
<seg id="84"> And yeah, some folks may be disappointed,  but that is on them, not on you.    </seg>
<seg id="85"> Those are their expectations of who you are, not yours.    </seg>
<seg id="86"> That is their story, not yours.    </seg>
<seg id="87"> The only story that matters  is the one that you want to write.    </seg>
<seg id="88"> So the next time you find yourself  in a pitch-black closet clutching your grenade,  know we have all been there before.    </seg>
<seg id="89"> And you may feel so very alone, but you are not.    </seg>
<seg id="90"> And we know it's hard but we need you out here,  no matter what your walls are made of,  because I guarantee you there are others  peering through the keyholes of their closets  looking for the next brave soul to bust a door open, so be that person  and show the world that we are bigger than our closets  and that a closet is no place for a person  to truly live.    </seg>
<seg id="91"> Thank you, Boulder. Enjoy your night.     </seg>

<title>Alex Wissner-Gross: A new equation for intelligence</title> 
<reviewer href="http://www.ted.com/profiles/2064042">Mad Aronson</reviewer> 
<translator></translator> 
<seg id="1"> Intelligence -- what is it?    </seg>
<seg id="2"> If we take a look back at the history  of how intelligence has been viewed,  one seminal example has been  Edsger Dijkstra's famous quote that  "the question of whether a machine can think  is about as interesting  as the question of whether a submarine  can swim."    </seg>
<seg id="3"> Now, Edsger Dijkstra, when he wrote this,  intended it as a criticism  of the early pioneers of computer science,  like Alan Turing.    </seg>
<seg id="4"> However, if you take a look back  and think about what have been  the most empowering innovations  that enabled us to build  artificial machines that swim  and artificial machines that [fly],  you find that it was only through understanding  the underlying physical mechanisms  of swimming and flight  that we were able to build these machines.    </seg>
<seg id="5"> And so, several years ago,  I undertook a program to try to understand  the fundamental physical mechanisms  underlying intelligence.    </seg>
<seg id="6"> Let's take a step back.    </seg>
<seg id="7"> Let's first begin with a thought experiment.    </seg>
<seg id="8"> Pretend that you're an alien race  that doesn't know anything about Earth biology  or Earth neuroscience or Earth intelligence,  but you have amazing telescopes  and you're able to watch the Earth,  and you have amazingly long lives,  so you're able to watch the Earth  over millions, even billions of years.    </seg>
<seg id="9"> And you observe a really strange effect.    </seg>
<seg id="10"> You observe that, over the course of the millennia,  Earth is continually bombarded with asteroids  up until a point,  and that at some point,  corresponding roughly to our year, 2000 AD,  asteroids that are on  a collision course with the Earth  that otherwise would have collided  mysteriously get deflected  or they detonate before they can hit the Earth.    </seg>
<seg id="11"> Now of course, as earthlings,  we know the reason would be  that we're trying to save ourselves.    </seg>
<seg id="12"> We're trying to prevent an impact.    </seg>
<seg id="13"> But if you're an alien race  who doesn't know any of this,  doesn't have any concept of Earth intelligence,  you'd be forced to put together  a physical theory that explains how,  up until a certain point in time,  asteroids that would demolish the surface of a planet  mysteriously stop doing that.    </seg>
<seg id="14"> And so I claim that this is the same question  as understanding the physical nature of intelligence.    </seg>
<seg id="15"> So in this program that I undertook several years ago,  I looked at a variety of different threads  across science, across a variety of disciplines,  that were pointing, I think,  towards a single, underlying mechanism  for intelligence.    </seg>
<seg id="16"> In cosmology, for example,  there have been a variety of different threads of evidence  that our universe appears to be finely tuned  for the development of intelligence,  and, in particular, for the development  of universal states  that maximize the diversity of possible futures.    </seg>
<seg id="17"> In game play, for example, in Go --  everyone remembers in 1997  when IBM's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess --  fewer people are aware  that in the past 10 years or so,  the game of Go,  arguably a much more challenging game  because it has a much higher branching factor,  has also started to succumb  to computer game players  for the same reason:  the best techniques right now for computers playing Go    </seg>
<seg id="18"> are techniques that try to maximize future options  during game play.    </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, in robotic motion planning,  there have been a variety of recent techniques  that have tried to take advantage  of abilities of robots to maximize  future freedom of action  in order to accomplish complex tasks.    </seg>
<seg id="20"> And so, taking all of these different threads  and putting them together,  I asked, starting several years ago,  is there an underlying mechanism for intelligence  that we can factor out  of all of these different threads?    </seg>
<seg id="21"> Is there a single equation for intelligence?    </seg>
<seg id="22"> And the answer, I believe, is yes. ["F = T ∇ Sτ"]  What you're seeing is probably  the closest equivalent to an E = mc²  for intelligence that I've seen.    </seg>
<seg id="23"> So what you're seeing here  is a statement of correspondence  that intelligence is a force, F,  that acts so as to maximize future freedom of action.    </seg>
<seg id="24"> It acts to maximize future freedom of action,  or keep options open,  with some strength T,  with the diversity of possible accessible futures, S,  up to some future time horizon, tau.    </seg>
<seg id="25"> In short, intelligence doesn't like to get trapped.    </seg>
<seg id="26"> Intelligence tries to maximize future freedom of action  and keep options open.    </seg>
<seg id="27"> And so, given this one equation,  it's natural to ask, so what can you do with this?    </seg>
<seg id="28"> How predictive is it?    </seg>
<seg id="29"> Does it predict human-level intelligence?    </seg>
<seg id="30"> Does it predict artificial intelligence?    </seg>
<seg id="31"> So I'm going to show you now a video  that will, I think, demonstrate  some of the amazing applications  of just this single equation.    </seg>
<seg id="32">  Narrator: Recent research in cosmology  has suggested that universes that produce  more disorder, or "entropy," over their lifetimes  should tend to have more favorable conditions  for the existence of intelligent beings such as ourselves.    </seg>
<seg id="33"> But what if that tentative cosmological connection  between entropy and intelligence  hints at a deeper relationship?    </seg>
<seg id="34"> What if intelligent behavior doesn't just correlate  with the production of long-term entropy,  but actually emerges directly from it?    </seg>
<seg id="35"> To find out, we developed a software engine  called Entropica, designed to maximize  the production of long-term entropy  of any system that it finds itself in.    </seg>
<seg id="36"> Amazingly, Entropica was able to pass  multiple animal intelligence tests, play human games,  and even earn money trading stocks,  all without being instructed to do so.    </seg>
<seg id="37"> Here are some examples of Entropica in action.    </seg>
<seg id="38"> Just like a human standing upright without falling over,  here we see Entropica  automatically balancing a pole using a cart.    </seg>
<seg id="39"> This behavior is remarkable in part  because we never gave Entropica a goal.    </seg>
<seg id="40"> It simply decided on its own to balance the pole.    </seg>
<seg id="41"> This balancing ability will have appliactions  for humanoid robotics  and human assistive technologies.    </seg>
<seg id="42"> Just as some animals can use objects  in their environments as tools  to reach into narrow spaces,  here we see that Entropica,  again on its own initiative,  was able to move a large disk representing an animal  around so as to cause a small disk,  representing a tool, to reach into a confined space  holding a third disk  and release the third disk from its initially fixed position.    </seg>
<seg id="43"> This tool use ability will have applications  for smart manufacturing and agriculture.    </seg>
<seg id="44"> In addition, just as some other animals  are able to cooperate by pulling opposite ends of a rope  at the same time to release food,  here we see that Entropica is able to accomplish  a model version of that task.    </seg>
<seg id="45"> This cooperative ability has interesting implications  for economic planning and a variety of other fields.    </seg>
<seg id="46"> Entropica is broadly applicable  to a variety of domains.    </seg>
<seg id="47"> For example, here we see it successfully  playing a game of pong against itself,  illustrating its potential for gaming.    </seg>
<seg id="48"> Here we see Entropica orchestrating  new connections on a social network  where friends are constantly falling out of touch  and successfully keeping the network well connected.    </seg>
<seg id="49"> This same network orchestration ability  also has applications in health care,  energy, and intelligence.    </seg>
<seg id="50"> Here we see Entropica directing the paths  of a fleet of ships,  successfully discovering and utilizing the Panama Canal  to globally extend its reach from the Atlantic  to the Pacific.    </seg>
<seg id="51"> By the same token, Entropica  is broadly applicable to problems  in autonomous defense, logistics and transportation.    </seg>
<seg id="52"> Finally, here we see Entropica  spontaneously discovering and executing  a buy-low, sell-high strategy  on a simulated range traded stock,  successfully growing assets under management  exponentially.    </seg>
<seg id="53"> This risk management ability  will have broad applications in finance  and insurance.    </seg>
<seg id="54"> Alex Wissner-Gross: So what you've just seen  is that a variety of signature human intelligent  cognitive behaviors  such as tool use and walking upright  and social cooperation  all follow from a single equation,  which drives a system  to maximize its future freedom of action.    </seg>
<seg id="55"> Now, there's a profound irony here.    </seg>
<seg id="56"> Going back to the beginning  of the usage of the term robot,  the play "RUR,"  there was always a concept  that if we developed machine intelligence,  there would be a cybernetic revolt.    </seg>
<seg id="57"> The machines would rise up against us.    </seg>
<seg id="58"> One major consequence of this work  is that maybe all of these decades,  we've had the whole concept of cybernetic revolt  in reverse.    </seg>
<seg id="59"> It's not that machines first become intelligent  and then megalomaniacal  and try to take over the world.    </seg>
<seg id="60"> It's quite the opposite,  that the urge to take control  of all possible futures  is a more fundamental principle  than that of intelligence,  that general intelligence may in fact emerge  directly from this sort of control-grabbing,  rather than vice versa.    </seg>
<seg id="61"> Another important consequence is goal seeking.    </seg>
<seg id="62"> I'm often asked, how does the ability to seek goals  follow from this sort of framework?    </seg>
<seg id="63"> And the answer is, the ability to seek goals  will follow directly from this  in the following sense:  just like you would travel through a tunnel,  a bottleneck in your future path space,  in order to achieve many other  diverse objectives later on,  or just like you would invest  in a financial security,  reducing your short-term liquidity  in order to increase your wealth over the long term,  goal seeking emerges directly    </seg>
<seg id="64"> from a long-term drive  to increase future freedom of action.    </seg>
<seg id="65"> Finally, Richard Feynman, famous physicist,  once wrote that if human civilization were destroyed  and you could pass only a single concept  on to our descendants  to help them rebuild civilization,  that concept should be  that all matter around us  is made out of tiny elements  that attract each other when they're far apart  but repel each other when they're close together.    </seg>
<seg id="66"> My equivalent of that statement  to pass on to descendants  to help them build artificial intelligences  or to help them understand human intelligence,  is the following:  Intelligence should be viewed  as a physical process  that tries to maximize future freedom of action  and avoid constraints in its own future.    </seg>
<seg id="67"> Thank you very much.    </seg>
